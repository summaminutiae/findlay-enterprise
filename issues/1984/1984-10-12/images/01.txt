big amount for the village of Fin-
diay,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] one resident, Bob Marquiss
said. Another, Donna Wildman
replied, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]How can you legally do it?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Neither question was answered
directly by board members. One
board member, Ron McClain replied,
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I pay taxes, but I also know we need

money "\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Riley said he sympathized with the
residents, \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]we just spent like crazy
the last few years." This reply drew
the first round of applause from the
audience.

In addition to problems with the
roads, other residents raised the
question of problems with drainage.
However, these weren't answered
either at which time McClain replied,

THURBER SAID THAT one thing
people could do to contro! spending is
to start attending the board meetings.
However, Mrs. Wildman questioned
that, \[OpenCurlyQuote]You mean if we start coming to
the board meeting we could control
your decisions?" To which Rodman
replied, \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]Don't sit back on your rear
end until it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s too late."\[CloseCurlyQuote]

Rodman also encouraged village
residents to attend meetings and
\[OpenCurlyQuote]talk it out\[CloseCurlyQuote] with the board.

The discussion about the higher
taxes ended when another village
resident, Mike Carr said, \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]we could
sit here all night. We're making a
general request, please take into
consideration our request and try to
do with a little less than $38,000.
We've been heard and thank you for
listening."
