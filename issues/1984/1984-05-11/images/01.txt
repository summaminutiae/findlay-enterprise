Nineteen pre-schoolers participated in a special ceremony Wednesday
morning, marking their graduation from the Reading Hour Program.

The pre-schoolers will attend kindergarten starting next fall. Included in
the class are (first row, left to right) Jimmy Rickey, Travis Parks, Zeth
Giles, Adam Sparks, Robin Wildman, Lindsay Waggoner and Krista
Shoemaker; (second row) Derek Cruit, Darla Vincent, Bryan Davis, Eric

Janet Bricker heard his call and
sent her husband, Herb, to rescue
them with a big tractor.

Perry\[CloseCurlyQuote]s career with the
service began when he started filling
in as a substitute clerk in May, 1948.
After his graduation from Findlay
High School in 1947, he worked for one
year at the Caterpillar plant in Peoria
arid for another year as a signal
helper for the C&EI railroad.

It was while he was with the
railroad that he began filling in at the
post office at Christmas time and
whenever else he was needed, and he
was never taken off the rolls,
although he served in the Air Force
from 1952 to 1955.

Perry followed in his father\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
footsteps by assuming the rural mail
route when. E.E. Perry retired in
1957. The elder Perry had served as a
carrier for 38 years.

The son has worked for three
postmasters in his 35 years -- John
Mauzey, Freida Keim and present

when the lake replaced a lot of homes
on his route.

Perry says he has enjoyed all of the
work he has done for the post office,

1 35 year career with post office

but \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I like the carrier part best. I
enjoy seeing what's going on around
the area and talking with farmers

postal along the way.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

The last six months have been bad,
he said -- \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]nothing but snow and
rain,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] but he intends to continue
carrying the mail -- at least for now.

The youngsters along the route
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t want to see him retire because
he always carries bubble gum along
on his route. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]On Saturday, if it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a
nice day, the kids are all out there
waiting,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said.
