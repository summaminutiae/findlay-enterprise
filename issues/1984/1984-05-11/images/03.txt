The sophomores re-elected Joe
Dunaway to be their class president
next year. Lance Beery defeated
Sherri Walden for vice president, and
Angie Uphoff was elected secretary-
treasurer over Melody Crickman and
Patti Sorrell.

The freshman class retained Sean
Creviston as class president for next
year. Mendi McClain, a write-in
candidate, defeated Lori Nunn for
vice president. Dana Miller was
elected secretary-treasurer.

The eighth graders voted on their

as freshman officers, but there were few

clear results. Greg Grant was elected
president over Joey Cummins and
Timm Rodman, and Brian Wood was

students elect officers

chosen as class sponsor.

The race for vice president ended in
a tie between Bradley Smith and
Kevin Rhoads. In the race for
secretary-treasurer, Linda Jackson

Francisco. A run-off election will be
held May 11 to break these deadlocks.

VILLAGE OF FINDLAY

NATURALGAS |
BUDGET BILLING PLAN

The Village of Findlay is offering a Budget Billing
Plan to all natural gas customers. The plan will start
with bills mailed out in June 1984 and cover 12

consecutive months.

£

The purpose of the plan is to allow Village

customers to average

their bills over a 12 month

i)

period rather than paying for actual usage each
month. A customer will still pay the same amount for
12 months under either method; however budget
billing allows customers to avoid the very large bills
of winter by paying more during the summer.
Sign-ups will be taken May 15 through May 3ist at
