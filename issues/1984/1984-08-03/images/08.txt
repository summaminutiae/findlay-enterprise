HIGH YIELDS PLUS SOME VERY IMPORTANT EXTRAS.

High rates. Higher yields. That's what you want
from your CDs. And that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s what you get from Citicorp
Savings. But you also get our extras. They make the
real difference!

To give you extra yield, we compound your interest
daily. That means higher income for you. An extra not
everyone offers.

And nobody else offers this. Expandable CDs. Both
6-Month and 22-Year terms. They're an exclusive

more to increase your investment. That lets you keep
the same high rate and maturity date without having

to open a whole new CD.

You enjoy extra security, too. Your deposits are
protected by FSLIC insurance and backed by one of
the world\[CloseCurlyQuote]s strongest financial institutions. That\[CloseCurlyQuote]s extra
comfort.

Come in. Or call your nearest Citicorp Savings

informative brochure that explains yield. We'll even
print out a free CD Yield Projection to show you how
impressive your investment will be at maturity.
