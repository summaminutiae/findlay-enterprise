Interest rates are up at Citicorp Savings.

Now may be the time to lock them in with one of our
longer term investments. Or, choose a short term and stay
flexible. Whatever you choose, we offer low minimum opening
deposits to get you started.

And be sure to compare yields before you decide. High
rates are important, but it's the yield that reflects the true amount
your investment will earn.

High rates. Higher yields. Proof that First Federal of

Chicago's change to Citicorp Savings is a change for the better.
