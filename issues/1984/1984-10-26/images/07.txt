use. The Equalizer is simply a payment
plan that averages your predicted annual
energy bill into equal monthly payments.

With the Equalizer, you'll have no
surprises, nO guessing, no up-and-down
trampoline ride. Just the same, exact bill
every month (subject to adjustment if the
cost, or your use, of energy changes sig-
nificantly). In any event, you pay only for
the energy you use.

Already, over 19,000 CIPS residential
customers have signed up for the
Equalizer. Why don't you put a stop to the
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]bounce\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] in your energy bill by jumping
over to the convenience of the Equalizer?
