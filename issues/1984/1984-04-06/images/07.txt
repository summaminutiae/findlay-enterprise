by Marilyn S. Biehler artificial vanilla flavoring sold south
Extension Adviser of the border -- often in quart jars --
No Toxic Vanilla in Illinois is suspected of being toxic.
Rumor. rumor. That\[CloseCurlyQuote]s the The substance-in-question is
word about that toxic vanilla coumarin (say: KOO-mar-in). It is

extracted from tonka beans, lavender

decomposes at just below 300 degrees
Fahrenheit. Because vanilla
flavoring is used in small amounts
and in foods that are baked at above
300 degrees F\[CloseCurlyQuote], the potential danger to
humans is small.

Some radio stations have advised
having the substance tested at \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]a
pharmaceutical lab,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] but testing is
hardly worth the cost and trouble
involved. Even if you could find a lab
to do the test, it would cost more than
$100.
