entering kindergarten is urged to
attend the clinic.

The clinic is open to any preschool

County Health Department can be

Beach construction will begin
soon at Eagle Creek State Park

Instead of travelling to nearby
towns to go swimming, Findlay area
residents will have the opportunity of
using a nearby beach.

An announcement was made
Monday morning that the State

of Conservation will
build a beach at Eagle Creek State
Park in time for summer recreation
use. The announcement was made at
a press conference at the state park.

State Rep. Michael Tate, R-
Decatur, said the decision to build the
beach on Lake Shelbyville came from
Charles Tamminga, associate
director for parks in the conservation

department.

The DOC will spend $15,000 to
$20,000 this summer to build the
beach. The beach will measure 50 by
200 feet of sandy area. This is some-
what scaled down from a proposal to
construct a 600 foot long beach
costing $40,000.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]T worked very hard during the last
year along with Pauline Briney

(Findlay mayor) and Greg Bohlen
(Bank of Findlay vice president) to
get it (the beach) open,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] Tate said.

Tate pointed to the impact on the
community last year when the DOC
closed Eagle Creek State Park for a
few months. He said that when she,
he, and DOC director David Kinney
came to reopen the park, they found
lots of community support for a beach
at Eagle Creek.

In making the announcement, Tate
said that the state would build two
beaches this year. In addition to the
one at Eagle Creek State Park, a
second beach will be built at Ramsey
Lake. There is only one other beach in
the State Park system.

There are three other public
swimming beaches on Lake
Shelbyville. They are operated by the
Army Corps of Engineers.

FUNDS TO CONSTRUCT the new
beach are not \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]new money,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Tate
said at the press conference. He said
the DOC found \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]that money was in

the budget they already have.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The
money will come out of the capitol
budget of Eagle Creek State Park
available because maintenance and
repair costs were lower than
projected.

In addition to the sandy area of the
beach, restrooms and additional
parking will be constructed as part of
the project. A parking lot for nearly
40 cars algeady exists at the site, but
will be enlarged to accomodate 150
cars.

There will be no bath or shower
facilities at the beach.

An archelogical survey of the beach
area was to have been completed this
week. The survey was necessary of
Corps of Engineers approval of the
project.

Tate said that with a beach at
Eagle Creek State Park, the DOC
would \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]probably not ever entertain
closing of Eagle Creek again.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He
said the beach will enhance the park
and bring more traffic.
