plant
were discussed by the Findlay Village
Board Monday night.

Village engineer Lee Sierkerka
detailed two small problems about which
he had contacted contractor Hal Har-
shman. He has received no reply on a
request to complete the repairs.

A problem with a generator unit was
detailed for the board by village em-
ployee Doug Ryherd. The generator is
not functioning properly and is using too
much oil. Harshman has been contacted
about repairs but has not responded.

A more serious problem with a trash
pump was detailed by sewer com-
missioner John Diss. The pump is_ not
operating properly, and Harshman has
been notified. In addition, Diss said
problems with the pump were listed on
the original punch list.

Diss said the pump was a necessary
item, especially in wet weather.

Harshman was formally notified of the

Eberspacher.
board that he asked for the pump to be

- fixed by Feb. 13, the meeting night. The

letter was sent Jan. 19.

As a result, Eberspacher recom-
mended legal action be taken against
Harshman on the trash pump problem.
Following a discussion, the board voted
4-1 to take action against the contractor.

Dwight Riley voted against the
measure because he felt the cost was
unwarranted. Voting for legal action
were Ron McClain, Larry Rodman, John
Diss and George Carter. Trustee Dave
Thurber did not vote; he was acting as
mayor in the absence of Pauline Briney. .

IN OTHER ACTION, the board
discussed building demolition for the
Sarah Tinnea and Melvin Yantis
properties. Action on these properties
was tabled by the board six months ago.

Because the property of Sarah Tinnea
is being sold with her estate, the board
decided to wait until new owners assume
the property before anymore action is
tak

en.

The board decided to allow use of the
old Okaw Theatre lot and part of the
street in front of the lot for the estate sale
of Mrs. Tinnea\[CloseCurlyQuote]s personal possessions.
Dave Brooks made the request to the
board on behalf of the executor George
Perry.

The board approved the purchase of a
new radar gun by Findlay village
policeman John Love. The unit was eight
years old and not working properly. The
new unit, which was being used by Love
on a loan basis, cost $1,150.

APPROVAL WAS GIVEN by the
village board for a new water line to be
installed at the new Findlay Community
Center. Brooks said that the present \[OpenCurlyQuote]-
inch water line would be inadequate for
the center\[CloseCurlyQuote]s needs.

Riley made a motion to approve the
installation of a %-inch water line. The
village will pick up the tab.

board to straighten out problems
snow removal. He outlined his policies

regarding snow removal for the village
of Findlay.

Crickman said the township (country)
would come before the town; he would
not be responsible for the schools, and he
would not plow any alleys.

The road commissioner also told the

board that even though most of the
township voters came from the town, the
big taxpayers came from the country. He
said that he was told Findlay village
voters contributed only $1,580 for road
tax purposes.
The board will remain with Crickman
and Todds Point Township Road Com-
missioner Morris Nichols for snow
removal.

Village treasurer Joan Lucas com-
mented on the success of a new policy
which has enabled all delinquent ac-
counts to be paid in full. Eberspacher
had advised Mrs. Lucas that when a
delinquent customer made a payment,
that payment be placed on the current,
rather than the earliest bill.

As a result of the new policy, several
hundred dollars in delinquent accounts
have been settled in the past month.
Eberspacher said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]this is a good
program -- it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s stopping the system
whereby customers subsidize people who
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t pay their bills.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

FOLLOWING A recommendaton from
Eberspacher, the board voted not to pay
prevailing wages for - maintenance
contract work. Paying prevailing wages
for work -- such as oil and rocking
village streets -- could cost the village an
additional $4,000 to $10,000 annually.

The action is based on the Illinois
mandates act which requires the
legislature to provide funds for any new
duties it imposes on local governments.
The Illinois legislature mandated that
prevailing wages also be paid for
maintenance work, effective Jan. 1.

Funds to make up the difference are to
be provided by the Dept. of Commerce
and Community Affairs. Part of the
motion approved by the board has
Eberspacher preparing a formal request
for funds under the mandates act.

Eberspacher told the village board
that his law firm, Dove and Dove of
Shelbyville, was the only law firm in the
state of Illinois to take the position that
paying prevailing wages for main-
tenance work falls under the mandates
act.

He also told the board that this same
position was taken by the Illinois Senate
committee that approved the bill, the
Illinois Municipal league and the DCCA.
However, the Dept. of Labor is opposed
to such a position.

The Shelby County Board approved a
similar motion.

THURBER REPORTED that Natural
Gas Pipeline would be reducing its rates
as of April 1. Thurber said that in a
comparison study of various natural gas
rates in Illinois, that Natural Gas
Pipeline had the cheapest rates. \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]We sell

Love asked for and was given per-
mission to follow through with the or-
dinance relating to abandoned cars. He
said that with warmer weather ap-
