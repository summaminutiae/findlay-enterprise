Me THINKS 1 pace sry

The sun sneaked under a cloud for a
brief moment so I sneaked in to write A
COLUMN. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m disappointed! I never did
get an Enterprise, and that seems to be
my favorite connection with home. I
wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t miss it as much if I were home
and knew what was going on, but I hate it
this way. I guess I should have given
Carolyn a more complete address like
204 Oakridge Drive, Arcadia, Fla. 33821,
and I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d be mighty happy to have the last
two issues also.

For those of you who know J.R. and
Rosie Carter I regret to inform you that
he\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a patient at Barnes Hospital in St.
Louis, and the prognosis is not good. I

I saw the Martins just before they left
for home, and did those kids ever enjoy
Florida. Especially Epcott Center,
Disney Land, Sea World and Busch
Gardens. They like the traveling, and I
just like laying in the sun. Does that
speak for laziness or not? I guess it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
good for me though, my blood pressure is
the lowest it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s been for years.

It seems like I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve missed some good
weather and some bad weather at home.
I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m glad I wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t there for the bad.
There\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll be plenty of that when I get
home. So I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m gonna enjoy the sunshine
while I can.

I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m anxious to see who wins the
Democratic nomination for president of
the United States. From what I hear and
read in the Florida papers I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t believe
the Blacks will vote enmasse for Jessie
Jackson. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m a Walter Mondale fan
myself. NATURALLY I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t see that
Reagan has been all that helpful,
although I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m sure a lot of you have.

I wish I had a Florida real estate
license. Property is moving much faster
here, and you wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t believe the
building that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s going on here. To tell the
truth I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t really wish for the license. I
wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t stay. here that long anyway. I
like to dodge the winter weather, but
most of the time I like to be in Findlay,
Ill: When I tell someone where I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m from
they want to know if it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s near Chicago. I
guess they think Illinois is mostly .
Chicago. But thank goodness it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s not, and
even though it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a fur piece from the
Windy City, I love Findlay, Ill.

Four of my sisters and two brothers in
law were guests at a cookout at the Lottie
home last week, and naturally we all
enjoyed that. Three of us are staying in
Arcadia and one near Bradenton so we\[CloseCurlyQuote]re
really close enough to get together now
and then. J.R. and Rosie were ready to
come down before he developed a-health

problem, or there would have been five of

us here. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m mighty lucky and mighty
lucky to have six sisters, and I ap-
preciate it. I can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t imagine how it would
be not to be from a big family. I just know
it couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be as much fun.

One the way from Kissimmee I came
through Haines City and strained my
eyes all the way through thinking I might
get a glimpse of one of the many Fin-
dlians that winter there, but no luck. I
didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t see anyone who looked familiar. I
told my sister they live in a trailer court,
and she said there must be a hundred of
them around Haines City, so I didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t try
to find anybody, but it would sure be nice
to see some familiar faces. I should have
gotten some addresses and phone
numbers before I left home. I always
think of everything too late. Hi to
everybody in the old home town, and I
miss all.
