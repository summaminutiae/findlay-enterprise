Continued from Page 1
proaching, there were several vehicles
that needed to be checked.

A report on a recent survey of Division
Street by a state survey team was given
by Rodman. He explained that as part of

a Dept. of Transportation engineer about
the program. He said that Findlay could
request state funding for sidewalk and
curb work to be done at the same time as
the road resurfacing project. The village
would have to provide part of the fun-
ding, but the state would also help with
the project.

The village will be working with Shelby
County Supt. of Highways, Star
Rheynard, on the project.
