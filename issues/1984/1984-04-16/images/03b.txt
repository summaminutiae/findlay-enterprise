vegetables such as peas, runner
beans and tomatoes by planting rows
of short, quick-growing crops such as
lettuce, radishes and summer
spinach. The trick is to learn enough
about the growth habits and nutrient
and water needs of the various crops
so that intercropped plants will not
compete for sunlight, food and
moisture.

-- CATCH CROPS OR SUC-
CESSFUL PLANTING. If
gardening enthusiasm is still high,
take advantage of the ground space
available after harvesting mid-
summer vegetables like peas and
salad crops and sow others like
chicory and Swiss chard, which can
be planted during midsummer and

harvested in the late summer or early
fall.

While it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s not always easy to plant
seeds during the hot summer months,
you can get a head start by
establishing seedlings prior to the
initial harvest. This way, when a
space opens up, all you have to do is
transplant the seedling.
