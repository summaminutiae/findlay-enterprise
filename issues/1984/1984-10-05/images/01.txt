Potential sites for a resort hotel on Lake Shelbyville
center on Wolf Creek State Park and Eagle Creek
State Park. The Illinois Dept. of Conservation
proposes spending $6.5 million on feasibility studies
and subsidies for private developers to build resorts

Shelbyville, New Salem State Park near Petersburg
and in the Rockford area. Construction could start
next year on the Lake Shelbyville resort which is to
include an 18 hole championship golf course.
Funding for the resorts will come from the recently

prospectus is needed to help the state
attract a private firm to build the
resort hotel. --

The state has allocated $6.5 million
to be shared by the Lake Shelbyville,
Rockford and New Salem projects for
the feasibility study and subsidy
starting the next fiscal year and $1.5
million the following two years. The
money is an \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]incentive to
developers,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Tamminga said.

The state is currently negotiating
with three hotels about the resort
development. \[OpenCurlyQuote]Shelbyville will have

a first class resort,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] according to the
DOC official.

He feels that construction on the
project could begin \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]the next con-
struction season,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] probably next
summer. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]As a rule of thumb it
should take them 15-18 months to
construct the hotel .. . and a year to
construct the golf course.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Of course,
all this hinges on what hotel firm
decides to build and what dimensions
it takes.

THE LOCATION \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]will also be
negotiable with the developer,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

that the state would not dictate to a
private developer where the resort
would be built.

In addition to the money allocated
for state parks, $21 million in Dept. of
Transportation road funds will be
spent to upgrade roadways in and
around the state parks to provide

better access to the facilities, the
Governor

said.
