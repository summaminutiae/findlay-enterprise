THE FINDLAY ENTERPRISE --FINDLAY, ILLINOIS 62534

Many years ago, there
community of families living in an

the name of Jeffris on it, and the book
was given to the Shelby County
Historical and Genalogical Society.
Wale te community no longer
exists, many family names are

Eagle Creek
As news is scarce and hard to find
We'll see if we can, in poetic rhyme
Name our neighbors, one by one
Going along in order they come.

First we'll start at Eagle Creek

Then up the hill and over the ridge
Just off the road we can plainly see
An antiquated cemetery.

E.P. Chapman is the first we find
Who is a man of generous kind |
amy formerly lived in the county
sea
nag Ae ey aR Pare He heed to

Herron\[CloseCurlyQuote]s are next as you all know

They are the best of people in
sickness and woe

They have been in our midst many
a day

And frequently say, we intend to
Stay.

\[OpenCurlyQuote]Uncle John Ayers not far away

Labors hard from day to day

He is always happy and full of glee

As he sails along over life\[CloseCurlyQuote]s wide
sea.

And Stevenses too along the route

ait venerable people beyond a

bt
Gain many friends wherever they

go
Believe in the adage \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]Pay as they
go.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

For lack of time we shall not dwell

So on to the next and then we'll tell

Its Miners and we're pleased to say

They are getting riches for the
rainy day.

Herron again though this is C.L.
a all the people know quite
He formerly had to wield the rod
While in the school room, a

pedagogue.

On adjacent farm toward the
southern clime

We find a man both true and kind
His name is Gravens and all can

see
That he firmly believes in integrity.

Baxters are next and hard to beat
a not a person Would he try to
t

And as a neighbor they have proved
To all around the Mahoney School.

5 Oe, See
_ Hho keeps his mind on the Sabbath

y

He labors hard from morn till night

And always transacts his business
right.

Next in line is Bachelor Bill

Who says if the women won't cook,
I will

Mr. Baxter is known far and near

Has lived on his farm for several
years.

Just across the road who may this
be

Yes, it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Phillipses whom we are
glad to see

We've found him to be a placid man

Who tries to do what good he can.

Olmsteads we'll name the next in
line

No better people can we find

They\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve many friends and enemies
few

And keep in touch with Golden
Rule.

Down the Mauzey road near the
stream

Where the waves of the Kaskaskia
can be seen

The water sparkles with diamond
rill

As the sun comes over the eastern

le Creek community

Faught we find along the way
Who owes no debt he cannot pay
He is an energetic and honest man
Who tries to earn whatever he can.

Not far away on the opposite shore

Shall remain memorial forever
more

Where Mr. Hidden the grain has

ground
As his mammoth water wheel turns
around.

A few of our neighbors we haven't
named

So we'll go north the way we came
We see the birds in the trees nearby
And hear them sing their lullaby.

Brickeys first down the eastern
lane ;

Who you know from Champaign
came

And for our part we're glad to
relate

That they haven\[CloseCurlyQuote]t a neighbor they

abominate.

On we go and Donnells we find
We\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll fairly name him in our rhyme
A sturdy and industrious man is he
Who is always busy as a bee.

Whitacres, we learn, are old
residents

Whom are ever happy and content
Uncle Eden fought under the Stars

and Stripes
Serving his country in the Civil
strife.
Hylands we find as you all know

Purchased the Cruit farm not long
ago

Findlians in the news

Clarence and Leota Klein spent the
weekend in Sadorus with Escoe,
Ellen and Brenda Denton.

Ron and Brenda McClain and Jerry
and Donna Johnson and Jerry and
Theresa Boehm of Shelbyville had
supper at Brookses in Shelbyville

They perform their duty day by day
No \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Weary Willie\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] do they turn
away.

And Jeffrises too how happy are
they

Who've resided here for many a
day

They are respectable people, so
sublime

They help those in need, are ever
kind.

Morses are next upon the hill
Who do their work with presump-
tuous will

Discharge their duty as days go
ee

Quite a distance northwest is
Blands

Who always lend a helping hand
Silas is now in his declining years

The Mahoney Schoolhouse with
changeless mood

Scores of teachers from this school
have come

And written their names high in the
halls of fum.

Well we are around and no further
shall go

We didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t find a person in desolate
woe

Now subscribe for the Enterprise
and pay up duly

We are yours and yours very truly.
