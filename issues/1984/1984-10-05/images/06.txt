Ted Anderson, district manager at
the Shelbyville Fish and Wildlife
Area headquarters near Bethany,
said refuges established in previous
years just north of Fox Harbor were
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]very ineffective.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

To be effective, Anderson said
refuges must provide \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]food, water
and non-disturbance until nature
calls them to move on. They have to
have a chance to rest and feed and do
whatever ducks do when they aren\[CloseCurlyQuote]t

an area to serve as a refuge.

We also look for an area we could

to find one which is acceptable to all
the groups who use it. The last one
apparently was the one where there
was a conflict this time.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
