\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You still have time
to take some of the
heat off this summer's

energy bills.\[CloseCurlyQuote]

Sign up for the Equalizer, our plan-
ahead equalized payment plan, now. It
will help you level out higher summer
cooling bills, as well as next winter's
higher heating bills.

How the Equalizer works: Your
average yearly energy bill will be divided
into 12 equal payments. You'll pay the
same amount each month, subject to
adjustment if the cost, or your use, of
energy changes significantly.

How the Equalizer helps you plan:

It eliminates guesswork. Knowing your
monthly payments in advance will make
it easier to plan for your energy bills.
