Here\[CloseCurlyQuote]s how to take the heat
off summer electric rates

Before air conditioning
was widely used, and when
electricity was less
expensive to generate, our
customers paid the same
rate for their electric service
all year around.

As more and more
customers installed air
conditioning, the demand for

energy grew steadily. To meet

this increased demand, our
generators must be ready
with a maximum supply, or °
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]peak load\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] of electricity

from June through September,

the air conditioning months.

The purpose of the higher
summer rates is to reflect the
higher costs associated with
the summer peaking season.

Why should those
who don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have air
conditioning have to

pay the higher
summer rates?

The summer rates aren't
designed as a penalty, nor
do they represent an
additional benefit to CIPS. --
Our rates must signal the
way in which our costs
actually occur. Because the
summer peak demand is
greater than the winter peak
demand, we have to have on

" buying

hand the additional
machinery (which means
additional investment and
operating costs) to meet our
customers\[CloseCurlyQuote] greater energy
requirements. You'll be
paying more for your
electricity from June through
September, and less in the
remaining eight months.

Even with the higher

summer rates, there
are steps you can
take to lower your
summertime bills.

- You can save energy and

energy-efficient
appliances, and using them
efficiently, means you'll use
less energy. If you're buying
an air conditioner, check the
Seasonal Energy Efficiency
Ratio (SEER) number on the
unit's name plate. The higher
the number, the less energy
you'll use for the unit's
operation. Ask your dealer
for details.

* By getting on our

Equalizer payment plan
you can level out your
energy bills. You'll pay the

people providing people with energy

same amount each month
throughout the year.

* We also have a number
of conservation booklets that
show many ways to greater
\[OpenCurlyQuote]energy efficiency. If you'd like
more information, or if you
think you may have a problem
paying your energy bills this
summer, please contact your
CIPS office. We're here to
help you in every way we Can.
