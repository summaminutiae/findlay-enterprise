THE MUSICAL \[OpenCurlyQuote] Two By Two\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] is
based on \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Flowering Peach\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] by
Clifford Odets. The music was
composed by Richard Rodgers and
the lyrics by Martin Charnin. While
none of the songs are terribly
familiar, there are some funny and
some beautiful.. My particular
favorite is a beautiful love song, \[OpenCurlyQuote]I
Do Not Know A Day I Did Not Love
You.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Other songs fit nicely into the
story: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]Put Him Away\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] when Noah's
children decide he may be réady for
the funny farm; \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You Have Got To
Have A Rudder On The Ark\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] when
they try to tell him how to build his

ancient man of 600-plus years old to a
spring chicken of 90.
etki Each of
the eight performers gave a strong

very impressive. Whoever portrays
Noah (the role was written for Danny
Kaye in 1970) needs to have
tremendous stamina, and Storch has
it. He never once falters or gives
anything less than 100 percent.
Much the same as Rex Harrison in

the very touching song, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]An Old
Man\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] when she chides her sons to be
kinder to their father, it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s not easy to
be old. Her performance gets
stronger and stronger throughout the
show and in her last scene, she gives
her most sensitive portrayal of a
dying womanstrying to make peace
among her family members.

THREE REGULARS portray
Noah\[CloseCurlyQuote]s sons. Co-producer Tom Marks
is the philsopher youngest son,
Japheth; Don J. Orlando, a member
of the 1983 resident case, is Shem,
Noah\[CloseCurlyQuote]s okiest and most responsible
son; and \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]Big Bad Burlesque\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Jack
Milo is the middle and least
responsible son, Ham.

Marks gives an excellent per-
formance as a troubled youngest son.
He is constantly clashing with his
father, defying authority and
questioning God. Yet, he is the most
sensitive and loving of the three sons.
The best of Marks\[CloseCurlyQuote] musical per-
formances was \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I Do Not Know a
Day I Did Not Love You.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Orlando gives a good performance
as the dutiful son. He has no problems
portraying the miserly Shem, really
loving his family deep-<down and
having to cope with the likes of a
nagging wife. His best number is the
duet performed with his wife, \[OpenCurlyQuote]As
Far As I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m Con-cerned.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Milo gives his performance the
perfect touch of wackiness. He\[CloseCurlyQuote]s the
middle son, Ham, something of a
ne\[CloseCurlyQuote]er-do-well who longs for
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]something of his own.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Milo con-
tinues to delight Little Theatre
audiences. They\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve come to expect
something extra from him and they
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t leave disappointed!

OF THE THREE who portray the
daughters-in-law, only one is a
newcomer. In her first role since she
obtained her Equity card, Flora Ann
McIntyre portrays the sweet wife of

in Chicago with Lee Graven.

Chris and Ronnie George spent
Friday night with Bill and Eileen
Wheeler of Mattoon at the Wheeler\[CloseCurlyQuote]s

Ham, Rachel. Back for her second
or me py gga gh
Sussman as Shem's wife,

the 1983 resident cast. Bickers is

drab apparel of Noah and his family.

McIntyre is excellent as the long-
suffering wife of Ham. She has a
beautiful voice and she uses it well in
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Something Doesn't Happen\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and in
the duet \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I Do Not Know A Day I Did
Not Love You.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] She\[CloseCurlyQuote]s something of an
ingenue, but she gives a professional
performance.

DIRECTOR MUGERDITCHIAN,
in his first appearance at the Little
Theatre did an excellent job. The
opening night performance was tight.
There were no lags and things
generally moved without in-
terruption. His direction was all the
more important because no one in the
cast had performed in the musical
before, so he was working with a

virgin group. |

In the technical area, the light by
Robert Behr was good, but the sound
effects by Adam Silverman were a
little overwhelming. The use of
thunder was just too much at times.
Also, I found it a little disconcerting
when the thunderclap was cut off
before it ran a more natural course.

As usual, musical director David
Fehr provided excellent direction.
This time, in addition to the piano and

how many different instruments were
supplying music, and it was all in the
; !

While not exactly appropriate as a
Bible school outing, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Two By Two\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
does accurately portray the story of
the flood and the ark. In general, the
being maudlin..

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Two By Two\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] continues at the
Little Threatre through July 8. Call
the box office for ticket information.

Brandy of Decatur are spending this
