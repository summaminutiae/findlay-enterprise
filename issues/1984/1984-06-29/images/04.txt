Livergood elevator
at Coles to expand

Livergood Grain Company, a
subsidiary of the A.E. Staley Mfg.
Co., is expanding its Coles Station
grain handling facility near Mattoon.

the elevator\[CloseCurlyQuote]s grain storage capacity
by nearly 400,000 bushels. The project
should be completed before this fall\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
harvest, Hickman said. At that time
the facility will be capable of storing
over 1.5 million bushels of grain.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The additional capacity
demonstrates our
providing marketing alternatives to
area farmers,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Hickman said. \[OpenCurlyQuote]The
expansion of Coles will allow us to
function more completely as an
inland grain terminal, buying direct
from farmers and shipping to a
variety of destination markets, in-
cluding Decatur and area processors,
river terminals, southeast
feeders and to the Gulf for export,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
he said.

Typically,\[CloseCurlyQuote] Hickman said,
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]farmers in our area have been
limited in their choices regarding
when and where to deliver their
grain. By strengthening Coles,
Livergood expects to broaden the
market area served by the facility
and to provide more efficient and
economical service to a growing list
of farmer customers.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]

The Coles Station elevator was built
in 1980. It is located on a rail siding
that will accommodate 125-car unit
trains. The facility is fully automated
with high speed grain receiving and

to Shipping capabilities. Its receiving

capacity is 15,000 bushels per hour
and its loading capability is 30,000
bushels per hour, with the expanded
storage space fully intergrated into
that system.

Coles Station is one of four
Livergood elevators owned by the
Staley Company in Central Illinois.
Staley also owns four country
elevators in the region through its
Ging, Inc., subsidiary.
