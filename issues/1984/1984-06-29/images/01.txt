Board going to court to recover costs to replace filter

by Marc Pacatte
News-Progress staff writer

Findlay's Village Board will sue to

recover money needed to bring the
sewer plant into compliance with
state regulations.
The trustees voted 40 at Monday
night\[CloseCurlyQuote]s meeting to have attorney
Chris proceed with a
suit to recover the estimated $162,000
necessary to replace the sewer
plant\[CloseCurlyQuote]s tertiary filter.

The action left Eberspacher with
the choice to name \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]whoever you
think\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] as the defendant in the case.

Trustee Dwight Riley, who was not
at Monday\[CloseCurlyQuote]s meeting, summed up the
woes surrounding the project when he
said, \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The whole thing has been a big
mess.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

The problems began, he said, when
the tertiary filter \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]floated out of the
ground before it was ever on line\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
after a heavy rain.

New grant funds to be sought

Rather than sitting back and
waiting for the outcome of a soon-to-
be-filed lawsuit, Findlay officials are
seeking funds to bring the tertiary
filter into compliance with state

The Board of Trustees voted
Monday night to submit a grant
application to the Environmental
Protection Agency and seek a loan
from-Farmers Home Administration
to complete the necessary work at the
sewer plant.

Lee Sierkerka, village engineer,
said he has \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]put together a set of
construction specifications which will
provide for rebidding of work
necessary to put the filter in com-
pliance with performance and design
standards\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] set by the EPA.

Sierkerka said the estimated cost
for the project is $162,000.

Although the village is seeking that
amount in the lawsuit, by applying
for the alternate funding, the project
will be finished regardless of the
suit\[CloseCurlyQuote]s outcome if funding is received.

The application to the EPA, which
Village Attorney Chris Eberspacher
said had to be submitted by July 1,

Sierkerka said a permit ap-
plication, grant amount request and
provisions for construction were all
sent to the state.

He told the board Monday that one
firm has \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]looked the existing units
over\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] and expressed interest in
bidding to complete the project.

The firm, Hydroclear, has plans to
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]gut the existing concrete and steel
walls and drop in their own package
unit,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Sierkerka said.

If this is the case, the structure
which currently houses the tertiary
filter would only serve \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]as a hole in
the ground,\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] Eberspacher said.

The Hydroclear filter is a two-cell
unit while the tertiary filter the

village has now is a four-cell unit.

However, Sierkerka said other
manufacturers \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]may come in and
bid\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] on the project.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]One or two other manufacturers
make similar units that they could
drop in,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]There are several possibilities
which we need to do in order to keep
the price down,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he added.

Sierkerka said he would \[OpenCurlyQuote]present
specs so that other manufacturers
would be willing to look at it (the
project), at the same time trying to
avoid the type of problem we got
ourselves into now.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]

The village will ask the EPA to fund
79 percent of the project, and he said,
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know what EPA\[CloseCurlyQuote]s reaction
will be.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

The request includes a restitution
clause and a favorable judgment
clause, which would direct any
money won in court proceedings be
paid back to EPA and FHA.

\[OpenCurlyQuote]We don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have any problem with
that,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Eberspacher said.

Trustee Dave Thurber asked
Eberspacher and Sierkerka what
happens after the requests are
submitted to EPA and FHA.

\[OpenCurlyQuote]Will we get any answer at all?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Eberspacher said a response would
probably be received in about six
weeks.

Until then, Sierkerka said the
village will have to \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]wait and see
what develops\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] with the applications.

\[OpenCurlyQuote]Where the money is coming from,
we don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] he said.

He added, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I have no idea how it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
going to break down\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] as far as
whether the EPA will pick up 75
percent of the project\[CloseCurlyQuote]s cost and
whether FHA has the money.

Thurber said Monday that if
Farmers Home \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have the
money they can tell us.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]
