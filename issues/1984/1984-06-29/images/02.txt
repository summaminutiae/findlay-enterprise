time we were allowed to start our
trek to Wyman Park in Sullivan. And
oh what fun we had.

I think at one time rides were three
for a dime so our usual 50 cents
usually allowed for quite a few rides
and maybe a snow or ice cream cone.

Times have changed drastically.
Now I'd be scared to death to ride any
of the rides. I wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t enjoy walking
around and around in the hot sun. I
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t like snow cones anymore, and I
can go two blocks down the street and
get a dern fine ice cream cone.

I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m glad I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have eight children
to send to the Wyman Park
celebration in this day and age. It
would probably cost a week\[CloseCurlyQuote]s wages
or more.

Old age must have crept up on me,

There are a lot of class reunions
and family reunions held at this time
of the year. Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t forget a lot of
people like to read about them, so
take the time to give us the highlights
of the reunions and who was there.

So the Conservation Department
says that maybe the beach will be
ready by Labor Day. I know it is not
their fault that the beach can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be
built sooner because of the high
water, but why Labor Day? I thought
most beaches closed for the season on
Labor Day. Oh well, maybe we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll
have better luck next year.

I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m still wondering if the State of
Illinois can legally force counties who
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have the money to build ex-
pensive jails? It sounds like dic-

ani :

More ang more the state and

governments are demanding
cities and counties do more and more.
Just where does democracy end and
dictatorship start? If I were on a
county board I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d simply vote no jail
until the money forthcoming

what\[CloseCurlyQuote]s done is none of their business.

I heard on the news one night last
week that Governor Thompson told
the teachers to go for all the money
they could get. Well, when you stop to
think how limited the schools are
financially, all they can get may not
be too much. Now, if the state wants
to do a better job funding the schools,
then it might work out better for the
teachers.

You know I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m firmly against
consolidation for the Findlay School
District, and I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve thought a lot about
it. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve decided they shouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t dictate
consolidation for us because for the
most part we pay for the schools here.
State aid received here doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t help
that much.

For all the years I can remember
the governor of the state of Illinois
has lived in the Governor\[CloseCurlyQuote]s mansion
-- not the Chicago boy. He has to live
in Chicago. I wonder how much that
costs the taxpayers in transportation
alone? Some people who could hardly
afford to get out of their own town
have to pay taxes for his whims.
Tain\[CloseCurlyQuote]t fair! Is it?
