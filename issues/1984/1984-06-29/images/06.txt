The story of Noah and the Ark goes
back a long, long time. In fact, you
can say that period of time is rather
remote and the principal figures are

"TE mintesl sialic nhidscnied
Tuesday night at the Little Theatre,
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Two By Two\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] brings these historic
figures alive. Noah and his family are
not just figures coming to us out of the

other fathers. . .he has a hard time
trying to get his children to listen to
him. First, they think he\[CloseCurlyQuote]s crazy
when he tells them God has spoken to
him and the world is going to be
flooded, next they challenge his
authority by telling him how to build
and run the boat, finally he is con-
stantly clashing with his youngest son
over why God is vengeful enough to
destroy every living thing except
those residing on the ark.

THE MUSICAL \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Two By Two\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] is
based on \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]The Flowering Peach\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] by
Clifford Odets. The music was
composed by Richard Rodgers and
the lyrics by Martin Charnin. While
fione of the songs are terribly
familiar, there are some funny and
some beautiful. My particular
favorite is a beautiful love song, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]'I
Do Not Know A Day I Did Not Love
You.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Other songs fit nicely into the
story: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]Put Him Away\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] when Noah\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
children decide he may be réady for
the funny farm; \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You Have Got To
Have A Rudder On The Ark\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] when
they try to tell him how to build his
boat, and \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]Ninety Again\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] when Noah
is miraculously transformed from an
ancient man of eT

of Creacy Keen, also formerly of the eight performers gave a strong

Findlay. For several years the family
lived in the Dwight Pogue farm house
northwest of Findlay.

Survivors include
Creacy Keen of Moweaqua, step
father Chester Keen of Moweaqua,
son David of Effingham, sisters
Susan at home, Tina Boyer of
Moweaqua and Debbie of West
Virginia. He was preceded in death
by his father and one brother.

Mr. Wolfe was found dead on the
MoPac Railroad tracks in Shelbyville
June 13. The cause of death is still
under investigation.

the production was Storch. He was
very impressive. Whoever portrays
Noah (the role was written for Danny
Kaye in 1970) needs to have
tremendous stamina, and Storch has
it. He never once falters or gives

anything less than 100 percent.

Carlson\[CloseCurlyQuote]s best musical number is
the very touching song, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]An Old
Man\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] when she chides her sons to be
kinder to their father, it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s not easy to
be old. Her performance gets
stronger and stronger throughout the
show and in her last scene, she gives
her most sensitive portrayal of a

THREE REGULARS portray
Noah\[CloseCurlyQuote]s sons. Co-producer Tom Marks
is the philsopher youngest son,
Japheth; Don J. Orlando, a member
of the 1983 resident case, is Shem,
Noah\[CloseCurlyQuote]s oldest and most responsible
son; and \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Big Bad Burlesque\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Jack
Milo is the middle and least
responsible son, Ham.

Marks gives an excellent per-
formance as a troubled youngest son.
He is constantly clashing with his
father, defying authority and
questioning God. Yet, he is the most
sensitive and loving of the three sons.
The best of Marks\[CloseCurlyQuote] musical per-
formances was \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I Do Not Know a
Day I Did Not Love You.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Orlando gives a good performance
as the dutiful son. He has no problems
portraying the miserly Shem, _
loving his family deep-<down and
having to cope with the likes of a
nagging wife. His best number is the
duet performed with his wife, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]As
Far As I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m Con-cerned.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Milo gives his performance the

ne\[CloseCurlyQuote]er-do-well who longs for
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]something of his own.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Milo con-
tinues to delight Little Theatre
audiences. They've come to expect

ing extra from him and they
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t leave disappointed!

OF THE THREE who portray the
daughters-inlaw, only one is a
newcomer. In her first role since she
obtained her Equity card, Flora Ann
McIntyre portrays the sweet wife of

McIntyre is excellent as the long-

DIRECTOR MUGERDITCHIAN,
in his first appearance at the Little
Theatre did an excellent job. The
opening night performance was tight.
There were no lags and things
generally moved without in-
terruption. His direction was all the
more important because no one in the
cast had performed in the musical
before, so he was working with a

virgin group. .

In the technical area, the light by
Robert Behr was good, but the sound
effects by Adam Silverman were a
little overwhelming. The use of
thunder was just too much at times.
Also, I found it a little disconcerting
when the thunderclap was cut off
before it ran a more natural course.

As usual, musical director David
Fehr provided excellent direction.
This time, in addition to the piano and
percussion, Fehr added a flute and
synthesizer. I tried to figure out just
how many different instruments were
aera aes and it was all in the

Bible school outing, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Two By Two\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

the flood and the ark. In general, the
performance was convincing without
being maudlin.

Little Threatre through July 8. Call
the box office for ticket information.
