Raising Dairy Calves

For dairy producers the months of
January through March are the most
difficult in raising young dairy animals.

Dairy producers need to reduce stress
on their young calves through a complete
management program. For example,
make sure cows freshen in a clean, dry
area that is free of
organisms. Feed each new calf color-
strum, two quarts or four pounds, within
a half hour after it is born.

Inject new calves with Vitamins A and
D. Because results from injections
seleium-vitamin E, iron and B-vitamins
vary, consider your own situation and
decide accordingly about providing the
injections. Dip calves\[CloseCurlyQuote] navels in iodine.

Provide calves with a digestible high
quality feed, such as frozen or soured
colorstrum, whole milk or a milk
replacer that contains 20 percent milk
protein, 10 percent to 20 percent fat and
less than 0.5 percent fiber.

Feed calves twice a day a total amount
of milk or milk replacer equal to 8 per-
cent to 10 percent of their body weight.
The milk or milk replacer should contain
about one pound of dry matter.

For example, if your calf weighs 100
pounds, it needs about 8 pounds of milk or
milk replacer a day,\[CloseCurlyQuote] divided into two
feedings. Mixing one pound of milk
replacer, dry matter, plus seven pounds
of water, equals eight pounds of feed, the
amount your calf requires per day.
Whole milk contains about twelve per-
cent dry matter and protein, fat and
lactose. So if you feed your calf eight
pounds of whole milk, that milk already
contains about one pound of dry matter.
