Jr. Women give New Year's resolutions

Members of the Findlay Junior
Woman\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Club answered roll call with
their New Year\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Resolution when they
met Jan. 16 in the home of Vicki Oldham.

A report on Reading Hour was given by
Elaine Smith. She explained that the pre-
school children will be working with
scissors. The recommendation to learn
how to use the blunt ended scissors was

tested on the use of scissors during pre-
school testing in the spring.

Lash reported on the success
of a recent fund raising project. Late last
fall club members sold holiday pecans
and black walnuts. All of the pecans have
been sold and there are 14 bags of black
walnuts left.

THE OUTCOME OF THE Operation
Santa Claus project was explained by
Mrs. Oldham. The club cooperated with
the Findlay Jaycees on this ge
which assisted 11 families with 32
children this past holiday.

Mrs. Oldham told the club that there
were less families but more children in
the project this past year. She thanked
Karl Kunzeman and Pat Knierim, in
addition to the Jaycees for their
assistance in getting the food and toys
delivered on time.

The Jaycees have suggested jointly

several events throughout the
year to put asidé money for this project.
The first event will probably be a dance
sometime during the next few months.
