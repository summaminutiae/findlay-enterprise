Plane makes
unschedulec
stop here

A Clinton pilot made an unscheduled
landing in Findlay Sunday afternoon
after encountering problems with
unexpected snow.

Leroy Taylor of Clinton, on his way
from a visit with friends in Shelbyville to
the airport in Lincoln, decided to make a
landing at the next available airstrip
when he encountered bad weather at
approximately 4:30 p.m. The airstrip he
landed at is one maintained by Woodrow
Enoch at the west end of Findlay.

Glen Wright heard the aircraft as it
passed over his home on West North
Third Street + he sid he was \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]99 percent
sure the runway was not clear,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] so he
went to the Enoch airstrip to help the
pilot get his craft out of a snowbank
where it was stuck.

The experimental aircraft was
equipped with almost no navigational
equipment, Wright related, and this was
the reason the pilot decided to make an
unscheduled stop.

Later when the Enochs returned home,
Woodrow and Wright helped Taylor tie
the plane down and Wright took the pilot
to Lincoln for his car and then followed
him on to his home at Clinton.

The plane is still parked at Enoch\[CloseCurlyQuote]s.

tentative property assessment

over the past three years to ae te
assessed value placed on those
properties by the county assessor.

If this three-year average level of
assessment is one-third of market value,

assessment is less than one-third of

20.27 percent of market value, based on
sales of properties in 1980, 1981 and 1982.

The equalization factor currently being
assigned is for 1983 taxes, payable in
1964, Last year\[CloseCurlyQuote]s equalization factor for
the county was 1.7469.

The tentative factor is subject to
change (1) if the County Board of Review
takes action which significantly affects
the county assessments or (2) if local
officials or others can present data
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]showing that the Department of

days after the tentative factor is
published in a newspaper of general
circulation within the county.

A change in the equalization factor
does not mean total property tax bills
will increase or decrease. Tax bills are
determined by local taxing bodies when
they request money each year to provide
services to local citizens.

If the amount requested by local taxing
districts is no greater than the amount
received in the previous year, then total
property taxes will not increase even if
assessments may have increased.

The assessed value of an individual
property determines what portion of the

tax burden a specific taxpayer will
assume. That individual\[CloseCurlyQuote]s portion of tax

responsibility is not changed by the
multiplier. ;
