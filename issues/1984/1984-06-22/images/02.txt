One day last week I was told by
Herb Campbell, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]If we don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t get some
of these buildings fixed up and
painted we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll never have any business
downtown.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] So I went to town and

in doing anything. There are others
who would not enjoy seeing it die and
might be interested in helping out in
any way they can.

If we\[CloseCurlyQuote]re ever going to go forward
the time is now. One thing for sure we
can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t go backwards anymore, and we
can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t sit on a fence or our village will
die for sure. So the only way to go is
forward, and we should have
years ago.

a small part of it is usable. Somehow I

I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve also heard from jailers that we

As opinions are formed regarding
the employees of the Village, please

also residents. Although their
scheduled time may be for eight
hours per day five days per week
their contact with the public, the
utility customers, is endless. By
mentioning minor problems to these
individuals at the grocery store, or
questioning an item with them at the
gas station, you are extending their
functions outside their normal
schedules. As employees of the
public, it is impossible for them to
escape this situation, and I feel they
should be commended for the in-
volvement they must provide daily.
As a member of the Village Board,
I encourage media coverage of all
meetings as conducted. I do not feel
that such coverage should be used as
a sounding board for any reason, and
opinionated coverage is not near the
same as responsible reporting.
Responsible reporting includes in-
vestigative talents, to determine the
background and reasoning for a given
action. It requires a lack of am-
biguity, performed by making the
coverage concise and to the point,
with no determination to be left to the
reader. There is a difference between
informing the public what transpired,
why it happened, and its intended
effect, than just reporting portions of
conversations heard throughout a
meeting. That is where the fine line is
drawn between and
irresponsible reporting. The Village
Board, the Village employees, the
customers and public all deserve the

Just a note:

For at least the past six months, the
water quality in Findlay has been
excellent. The water was sparkling
clear -- it tasted good, i
good, it looked good.

For the past week, the water has
been absolutely obnoxius. It stinks, it
looks awful and on a scale of one to
