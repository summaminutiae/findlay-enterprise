Doug Ryherd has operating permit

In the Village Board story ap-
pearing in the June 15 issue of the
Enterprise, it was incorrectly
reported that neither utilities
department employee had received
an operating permit from the state.

Doug Ryherd received his Class
Four Wastewater Treatment Works
certificate in March of 1983.

Ryherd becomes eligible for a
Class Three license in August, and he

plans to obtain that then.

There are four stages of cer-
tification for both wastewater
treatment and waterworks, with
Class One being the highest possible
certification under state En-
vironmer.tal Protection Agency
regulatons.

The Enterprise regrets the over-
sight.
