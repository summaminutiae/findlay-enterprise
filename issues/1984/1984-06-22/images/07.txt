Chappell Clark who left us June 25.

loving. What we would give to hear her
voice and see her smiling face. The grief
is still within our hearts as we think of

won't solve anything.

We may be able to help. If you think you're
going to have trouble paying your bill, there's
usually no reason why the problem can't be
worked out. If you foresee a problem, please
let us know.

We have several plans to assist you in
making payments:

- PREFERRED DUE DATE OPTION. ff you are
a residential customer on a fixed income, you
may be eligible for this option which extends

for 10 days the normal due date of your bill.

- DEFERRED PAYMENT AGREEMENT. If you
are unable to pay your entire bill at one time,

payments can be arranged.

- ENERGY ASSISTANCE. We can put you in
touch with public and private agencies to see
if you qualify for energy assistance funds.

+ THE EQUALIZER. With our level payment
plan, you can make equal monthly payments
throughout the year, helping you plan your
energy costs.

We don't want to disconnect any customer
for non-payment. Neither of us benefits in that
situation. So, please get in touch with us .. .
before your bill becomes past due.

We're here to help you in every way we can.
