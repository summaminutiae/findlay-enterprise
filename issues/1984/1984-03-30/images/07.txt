A new business opened in Findlay last month. Gary Wagner (right)
opened the busines, G.W.'s Place, and he is assisted by Clarence
Owens. The business, which includes recreational equipment such as
pool tables and game machines, is open seven days a week. Wagner
said his business caters to all ages and is the only business open at night.
Snacks are also available.

- DON\[CloseCurlyQuote]T LET YOUR KITE PUT
YOU IN TOUCH WITH TROUBLE!

Kite flying has captivated kids of all
ages for centuries. But flying a kite is
more complicated today, it can put you in
touch with an overhead power line.

Wire and metallic string are direct
pathways of electricity from an overhead
line to you. Any type string can conduct
electricity when it's wet.

If you build a kite, use only wood,
plastic, cloth, paper and string. Never use
wire, metal or metallic string.

*

Before you catch the wind, find an
open area away from overhead lines,
and antennas.

If your kite does get caught in an
overhead line, don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t try to pull it down.
Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t touch any dangling strings or wires.
Do call your CIPS office and we'll help ~
solve the problem. . . safely.
