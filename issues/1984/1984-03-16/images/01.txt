Rodman said that as streets and alleys
commissioner he directed Bricker to
take care of any other snow storms that
hit the area, including the one that
dropped over four inches of snow Mon-
day afternoon and evening.

During the discussion on snow
removal, Rodman reaffirmed the policy
that the village would not be responsible
for alleys. Two exceptions were made,
behind the post office and at Findlay

welcome at the bloodmobile. A nursery
will be provided.

The Red Cross supplies'blood for 140
hospitals in this region. Everyone in the
community needs to support the blood
program, the auxiliary unit pointed out.

Basic requirements for giving blood
are that an individual must be 17 years
old. Anyone over 65 can donate blood, but
they need a written slip for their doctor.
Other requirements are that an in-
dividual must weigh at least 105 pounds
and be in general good health.
