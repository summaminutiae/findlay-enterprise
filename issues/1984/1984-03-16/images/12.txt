Board reviews several problems

Continued from Page 1
the fact that the sewer revenue fund is in
trouble. In addition to large outlays from
the fund to cover construction costs for
the new sewer project, each month the
revenues do not equal expenditures.

With a February closing balance of
$2,700, the fund fell far short of the $5,200
in bills the board approved Monday
night. Over $20,000 has been transferred
out of this fund to pay construction costs.

The board that these funds
would be repaid when the final payment
for the sewer project was received from
the Environmental Protection Agency.
Problems getting the sewer plant
completed because of the tertiary filter
and final approval from the EPA have
held up this final payment.

A payment of $57,000 is expected once
the project is completed. No mention was
made at the board meeting of when this
would take place.

Village treasurer Joan Lucas reported
that financial records for the sewer
project had been audited by the EPA,
and everything went \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]okay\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. Mrs. Lucas
told the board that the head auditor for
the internal affairs of the EPA, Bill
Romack, had conducted the audit.

Romack, who had attended school in
Findlay, was \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]pleased to come back\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote],

SEVERAL ALTERNATIVES were
discussed to relieve the cash flow, and
the board eventually decided to transfer
$10,000 from the gas fund into the sewer
revenue fund to cover the deficits.

One trustee, Dwight Riley, pointed out
that while expenses in the fund were
increasing, revenue was decreasing
because sewer customers are cutting
back. Sewer bills are based on how much
water a utility customer uses. Several
large water users, including a laun-
dromat which used to be located in
Findlay, are no longer operating, and
water consumption has decreased.

| Several alternatives were discussed,
including hiring another crossing guard,
asking the school board to help foot the
cost for another crossing guard or having
a teacher or student act as a crossing

proximately $2,100 per year for one
crossing guard to help students cross
Division Street.

Village Clerk Mike Hartman objected
when he said \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]that didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t make much
sense ... you're talking about buying
new trucks and property for future use\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]

. and can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t afford another crossing guard.

Because of problems with one village
truck, the board discussed the possibility
of purchasing a new one rather than bear
the cost of additional repairs. The board
also discussed the possibility. of pur-
chasing a piece of property adjacent to
other village owned property for future
expansion purposes.
