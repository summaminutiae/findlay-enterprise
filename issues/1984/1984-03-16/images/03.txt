fiesta.

helping to raise these funds ap-
proximately eight years ago.

AS PART OF THE proposal, Riley
asked for board permission to work with
individuals and organizations in the
community to release the funds for
purchase of the lots and do some
preliminary planning on the park.

He also asked for permission to run a
survey among Findlay village residents.
The survey, which appears elsewhere in
the Enterprise, asks whether residents
would be in favor of a park and for their
comments on the proposal.

Anyone completing the survey should
return it to Riley or the village hall by
Saturday, March 24.

The property that is proposed for the
new park is going to be auctioned at a
sale of Mrs. Tinnea\[CloseCurlyQuote]s private property
Saturday, March 31.

Riley also proposed using revenue
sharing funds to take care of main-
tenance and utilities at the park. He said

Do you, the people of

that most residents would probably be
concerned that a park would mean more

mowing work could be done by village
employees, that costs for the park could
be kept to a minimum.

OTHER BOARD members didn't
express opinions one way or another on
the use of revenue sharing funds for
maintenance and operation. They also
didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t say whether or not it would be a
good idea for village employees to mow
the proposed park once a week in the
summer.

The initial funds for a Findlay park
came from the fund raising efforts of
several organizations at a Findlay Bi-
Centennial celebration in 1976. Over
$1,000 was raised as a result of several
different activities held in Findlay July 3
and 4, 1976.

Approximately six years ago, ap-
plication was made to the Department of
Conservation for grant funds for the
purchase and development of property
for a proposed park. The application was
turned down.

As Riley pointed out, if Findlay
already had the land purchased for a
park, it might be easier to apply for grant
funds to develop a park. The proposed
property is ideal for a park because it has
several trees and an undeveloped road
that divides the lots.

Riley doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t foresee the necessity of
purchasing any other land. He said that
many people were concerned before that
farmland would have to be purchased to
establish a park, but this is not the case
with the Tinnea property.
