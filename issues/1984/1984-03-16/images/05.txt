Common wisdom has it that rates are going up. The question is, when, and
what to do with your money while you're waiting? :

If you think interest rates will go up within the next six months, the answer
is a liquid investment like our Insured Money Market Account. If you think rates won't
go up until the fall, then choose our 6-month Expandable CD.

Either way, your money will earn a competitively high interest rate. And be
available to you when rates reach a level you'd feel more comfortable about locking into.
