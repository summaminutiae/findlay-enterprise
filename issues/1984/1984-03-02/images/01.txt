Winter returned with a vengence Monday morning -- dumping snow and keeping Findlians indoors for two days. High
winds and as much as a foot of snow left lots of streets impassible until Wednesday, despite hard work by township road
crews and others. West North Third Street was one of the hardest hit sections of town, with several cars buried under deep

drifts.

Blizzard hits Monday _ Findlay teen killed

Just when it seemed like spring § The local firemen received calls about «
- weather was setting in for good -- Fin-

road cortitions by C.B. radios and
telephone. Others called to ask about
what to do if there were an emergency --

mainly what would happen if an am-
bulance was needed.

Snowmobilers and owners of four
wheelers were contacted to stand by if
they were needed for emergencies. Glen
Wright volunteered to walk to reach a
person if transportation was impossbile.
His National Guard training and

The locai firemen were Charlotte
Newman, Penny McClain, Jeff and
Marsha Allen, Jim Chance and Benny

For the second time in a little over a
week, a Findlay teenager has died in a

Michael T. Cox, 17, of rural Findlay
and his passenger, Debra L. Organ, 17, of
Shelbyville were pronounced dead at 9:30
p.m Saturday at the scene of the ac-
cident, approximately one mile north of
Shelbyville on Country Club Road.

The cause of the one car accident has
not been determined. Cox was nor-
thbound and apparently failed to
negotiate a slight right curve in the
pavement. The car struck the west
culvert head-on and lost a front tire and
much of its underbody. The collision
apparently caused an explosion and the
car was gutted by fire. The passengers
were not thrown from the vehicle.

The accident, which was estimated to
have occurred at 9:0 pm., was
discovered at 9:15 and Shelbyville police
and fire and State Police were dispat-
ched. The Shelby County Rescue Squad
removed Cox and Organ from the car.

State police said no physical evidence
of alcohol use was found at the scene. The
