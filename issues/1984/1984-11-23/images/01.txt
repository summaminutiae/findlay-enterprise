the gym. The board allowed use of the

or the concerts with a $25 fee,
fe when the temperate drop

however, that the bids came in under

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They were quite a bit under
budget; we were well pleased,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] the
superintendent said.

He explained that weather may
hinder early remodeling work on the
outside of the high school; however,
by spring, when \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]the weather breaks
we will see a lot of construction.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

local participants

The Findlay High School band has
extended an invitation to members of
the community with musical talents
to play with the band between games
at home basketball games.

Anyone is welcome to play almost
any instrument with the high school
band. The school has several in-
struments available that interested
participants are welcome to use free
of charge.

COURSE RESULTS AVAILABLE

The Shelby County Health Dept.
has received the results on the final
exam for the foodservice sanitation
course that was recently offered. For
more. information contact Wanda
Price at the Shelby County Health
Dept., 774-9555.

ANOTHER REQUEST TO use the
high school gym was also approved
by the board. Tim Morse and
Williams requested use of the gym for
playing basketball on Sunday af-
ternoons, December through
February. They would like to start
playing Sunday, Nov. 25.

In allowing the use of the gym for
basketball, the board set a fee of $25
per session ($30 if the scoreboard is
used) and indicated that Morse,
Williams or Herb Bricker Jr. would

be responsible for getting the gym
key from Hash and taking care of the
lights and heat. The gym is available
only when a Findlay team is not
playing.

Hash gave a report on the status of
the cafeteria project. The ceiling was
lowered and new lights were in-
stalled. The new furnace has not yet
been installed. The present furnace
did not adequately keep the cafeteria
warm in cold weather.

Lake Shelbyville resort
feasibility study on track

The feasibility study for the
resort at one of the two
Illinois State Parks on Lake
Shelbyville is running on track and
should be finished Dec. 1, says
Charles L. Tamminga, associate
director of the Lands and Historic
Sites division of the Dept. of Con-
servation.
Advertising soliciting proposals

from prospective developers and
operators is scheduled to begin ap-
pearing in hotel trade papers and the
national \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Wall Street Journal\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] in
Decatur.

Civil engineers have been making
on-site inspections and surveys at
both Wolf Creek and Eagle Creek
State Parks during the past ten days.

The proposed resort is to consist of
an 18-hole championship golf course,
a hotel and possibly facilities of water

recreation on the lake. Some of the
cost of the project is to be from the so-
called \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]soda pop tax\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] which is
earmarked for expansion or
development of existing state parks.

\[OpenCurlyQuote] Under a plan of action that was
detailed by Tamminga a month ago,
the prospective developers will have
a choice of either Wolf Creek or Eagle
Creek. No community input on the
virtues of either site is being
solicited.

However, Wolf Creek, in Windsor
Township, and Eagle Creek, in Okaw
Township, are both in parts of Shelby
County that do not allow the sale of
alcoholic beverages at retail. For the
resort to operate a bar or to sell
alcoholic beverages with meals, it
will be necessary for the local option
prohibition to be ended. This will
require an election.
