Redbirds split
with Bethany

Findlay\[CloseCurlyQuote]s fifth grade Redbirds won an
exciting basketball game over Bethany
Monday evening. The score was tied 12 to
12 at the end of regulation time.

In the overtime, free throws by
Shannon Cloyd and Andy Scott enabled
the Redbirds to win by a 15 to 13 score.

Brad Stockdale scored two baskets,
Tracy Coleman had a free throw and
Scott, Clint Regan and Robbie Mowry
each had one basket for Findlay during
the game.

Also seeing action were Lonnie
Jackson, Donald White, Chris Thurber,
Terry McClain, Harvey Gordon and
Gary Beals.

The sixth graders lost by a score of 37
to 14. The score was 5 to 4 in favor of
Bethany at the end of the first quarter.
The opponents height advantage was too
much for the Redbirds from then on,
however.

Scoring a basket apiece for Findlay
were Eric Knierim, Ron Cloyd, Aaron
Gravens, Bobbie Chance and Mike
Voyles. Jarret Brown had two baskets.

The next game is at Windsor on Feb. 1.
