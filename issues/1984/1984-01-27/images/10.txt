Falcons continue to roll

The Findlay Falcons entertained
Assumption on Friday, Jan. 20 and
Cowden-Herrick on Tuesday, Jan. 24 and
came away with two more wins.

The Assumption game was Findlay\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
Homecoming and the Falcons responded
with a 66-57 win to excite the large home
following. -

Findlay defeated Cowden-Herrick 87-
71 for their second win over the Hornets
this season.

The Falcon Jr. Varsity also defeated
both teams to increase their season
record to 9-1.

Assumption\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Comets did not have the
great record they have had for the last
few years, but they do have one of the
conference\[CloseCurlyQuote]s best players in 6\[CloseCurlyQuote]5\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Todd
Bugg.

The Falcons got off to a great start
against the Comets rolling to a 22-8 first
quarter margin on the strength of Gary
Grant\[CloseCurlyQuote]s 10 points. Bugg finally got on
track after the first quarter and scored 25
points for the game: ~~ ~_ .

to nine at halftime, but Findlay came
back in the third to regain a comfortable
lead. Gary Grant played an outstanding
game for Findlay scoring 27 points. Tim
Rothrock and Mike Strohl added 12 and
10 points respectively for the Falcons.

The Cowden. game was almost the
same as the Falcons jumped to an early
and big lead. The Hornets seemed unable

to do anything right in the first
and Findlay responded by
27-8 lead. |

The rest of the game was played
relatively even by the teams. Gary Grant
led Falcon scoring with 21 points, but
balance was the.key as Mike Strohl,
Brett Cummins and Jody Getz were all in
double figures, and five other Findlay
players scored.

Findlay got in a little foul trouble later
in the game and gave the Hornets 27
opportunities at the free throw line. They
capitalized on 19 of the shots compared to
11/17 for Findlay.
