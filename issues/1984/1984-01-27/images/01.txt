Citicorp now
operating
First Federal

First Federal Savings and Loan
Association became a savings and loan
subsidiary of Citicorp Jan. 20. Citicorp
said the day-to-day business of First
Federal and its 61-branch network will be
uninterrupted as programs are initiated
to revitalize the institution.

First Federal has a branch office in
Findlay.

Barry C. Burkholder has been named
chairman and chief executive officer of
First Federal, which has $ billion in
assets. Burkholder previously headed
the mortgage banking division of
Citicorp\[CloseCurlyQuote]s national home loan subsidiary,

Person-to-Person, St. Louis.
John Ream, who has headed the Mid-
western region for Person-to-Person, has
been selected as president.

As a separate Citicorp savings and
loan, First Federal joins two other
Citicorp thrifts, Biscayne Federal
Savings and Loan based in Miami and

Biscayne, like First Federal, became
part of Citicorp today after the Federal
Reserve Board approved both
acquisitions through a bidding process
with the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board. Citicorp Savings, formerly
Fidelity Savings and Loan of San
Francisco, was acquired in September,
1982, under circumstances similar to the
acquisition of First Federal and New
Biscayne. In the year-plus since then, it
has returned to profitability and
resumed providing a full range of con-
sumer financial services, including new
home mortgages at the rate of $60 million
a month

The acquisition of First Federal is the
latest development in a Citicorp plan
tracing back to the mid-1970s to build a
business committed to providing con-
sumer financial services around the
world.

With the acquisitions of First Federal
and Biscayne, Citicorp now can provide a
full range of savings and lending services
for customers in markets representing 35
percent of the nation\[CloseCurlyQuote]s families and 43
percent of deposits.

Citicorp currently. serves 10 to 20
million customers in the United States,
providing some $12 billion of home
mortgages, $8.9 billion of credit card and
other types of personal loans and $1
billion of student loans.

Citicorp\[CloseCurlyQuote]s major consumer businesses
include Citibank in New York, that
metropolitan area\[CloseCurlyQuote]s largest bank and
mortgage lender; Citicorp Person-to-
Person and Citicorp Acceptance, with 134
personal and home finance offices in 35
states; Citibank Travelers Checks
worldwide; Diners Club and Carte
Blanche, international travel and en-
tertainment cards owned by Citicorp;
Choice, a proprietary credit card serving
the Baltimore-Washington and the
