Tertiary filter repairs
will cost $40,000

Repair costs on the tertiary filter at
the sewer plant will total nearly
$40,000, the Findlay village board
learned Wednesday evening. Repair
of the filter is holding up completion
of the sewer project which in turn is
holding up final release of funds to the

village.

The filter, which has never worked
properly, will be prepared according
to design specifications provided by
the engineering firm of Upchurch,
Davidson & Assoc. The designs and
cost estimates were presented to the
board Wednesday.

the Illinois Environmental Protection
Agency to approve the work and
possibly provide additional grant
funding of 75 percent to pay for the

repairs.

Board members have stated, both
at this meeting and past meetings,
that the village is not willing to stand
any expense in repairing a piece of
equipment that has never worked
properly. According to figures
provided by the engineer, the
village\[CloseCurlyQuote]s share could amount to
$9,935

BEFORE DECIDING whether to
approve the design specifications and
the change order to the E.P.A., the
board went into an hour-and-a-half
long closed session to discuss
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]pending litigation\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] on the adviser of
attorney Chris Eberspacher.

Attending the closed meeting with
board members were Jim Upchurch
and Lee Sierkerka of the engineering
firm, sewer plant contractor Hal
Harshman and Eberspacher.

After the meeting was opened,
trustee Dave Thurber made a motion
to instruct the village attorney \[OpenCurlyQuote]to
take whatever action necessary to
that the work is performed on the
tertiary filter . . . to allow 90 days for
completion of the project. Also, to
instruct the attorney to determine

among all parties concerned how the
village\[CloseCurlyQuote]s share of $9,985 will be split.

Thurber also made a part of the
motion the stipulation that \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]the
village does not desire to incur any

part of the expenses\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] to repair the
filter. A report on the project will be
made at the regular June 11 meeting.
All trustees voted for the motion.
Trustee George Carter was not
present

NO OTHER ACTION was taken at
the adjourned meeting; however, the
board did discuss salaries and
benefits of full time village em-
ployees. Several suggestions and
comments were made, but no action
was taken.

Thurber provided information
which indicated the salary and
benefits of each village employee.
The cost to the village of each em-
ployee (for wages and benefits)
totalled over $60,000 for the last fiscal
year.

Formal salary action will be taken
when the board takes action on the
appropriations ordinance next
month.

Thurber also announced that the
village has hired, through the federal
Jobs Training Program, four sum-
mer employees. The employees will
be Jeff Voyles, Brian Voyles,
Rhaunda Ikemire and Marlida
Rockwood. Mayor Pauline Briney
will oversee the project. Federal
funds will pay for the cost of the
wages.

An announcement was made that
the annual federal revenue sharing
hearing will precede the regular
monthly meeting at 7 p.m. Monday,

June 11.
