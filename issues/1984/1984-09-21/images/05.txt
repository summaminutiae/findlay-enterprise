Restoration of Model T
takes Getz over a year

Forest and Denny Getz are quite
proud of their Model T\[CloseCurlyQuote]s. They have
good reason to be proud; it took a lot
of hard work to restore the two
vehicles so they would be not only
presentable, but admirable.

Forest\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Model T is a 1927 model he
bought \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]As is\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] in Mattoon. Denny\[CloseCurlyQuote]s,
a 1923 model, was a \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]basket case.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
He bought a body and running gears
in Missouri. There was no upholstery
and he had to take it apart piece by
piece. There was also no top or no
interior. In addition, there were no
springs in the seat.

It took Denny a year and a half to
completely restore the car. The work
included reworking the
\[OpenCurlyQuote]motor, transmission, rear end,
chassis -- every piece had to be taken

completely finished the restoration in \

September, 1983. Forest purchased [\\ s

his Model T in April, 1984.

Now that the two cars are in good
working order, they are used in
parades and antique car shows. The
top speed that Denny\[CloseCurlyQuote]s car reaches is
45 miles per hour although he usually
drives it at-about 30 miles per hour.
Forest goes about 35 miles per hour.

The cars were a popular entry at
the Findlay Days parade earlier this
month. Forest and his wife Betty rode
in one Model T and Denny and his
wife, Iva Kay, rode in the second car.
