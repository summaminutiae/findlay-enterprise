know and even the ones I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know
who beat the streets looking for jobs.
Most of them inight as well save the

there ain\[CloseCurlyQuote]t no crock. He also flies a

He don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t need all those people and
Nancy don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t need to travel with a hair

pay for a hair dresser to travel with
her \[OpenCurlyQuote]cause her hair don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t look that
good anyway. I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have a claim to
fame but I could improve on her hair
style and I make less in a year than it
costs her to take the stylist to Europe
with her. No, times ain\[CloseCurlyQuote]t getting
better and I expect them to get worse.
I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m a Democrat. Yes! But if I really
thought times were getting better I
could sure switch in a hurry. I may
not be super intelligent but I ain\[CloseCurlyQuote]t that

I can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t believe how fast the dead

Attorney general opinion could
complicate assessor election

- Special from the

Shelby County News-Gazette
An opinion by Illinois Atty. General
Neil Hartigan that candidates for
election as supervisor of assessments
must meet the same statutory
qualifications as appointed assessing
chiefs may complicate the Shelby
of

candidate Marjorie Pierce,

Mrs. Pierce, a former employee of
the offices of the circuit clerk and
county treasurer, is running for the
assessing job against
Democratic incumbent Linda Cook,

Shelbyville, in the wake of a Shelby °

County referendum making the office
elective.
In the opinion, Hartigan said

persons seeking election to the county
offices of assessments supervisor or
highway superintendent must
possess \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]all statutory qualifications
appertaining\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] to the office
regardless of whether the method of
selection is election or appointment.

All that switching from ap-
pointments to elections does is
change the manner of selection,
Hartigan said. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It does not excuse the
requirements of the office.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Mrs. Pierce\[CloseCurlyQuote]s principal problem in
light of the opinion may be the fact
that she has not taken and passed an
assessing test administered by the
Illinois of Revenue.
State law also calls for two years of
experience in real estate,

arrange to write the assessment
exam. She was not familiar with the

Unlike a high court decision, an
attorney general\[CloseCurlyQuote]s opinion does not
establish unassailable law, but it does

provide significant guidance for
-- officials, judges and
wy

ers.
If Mrs. Pierce is elected Nov. 6, if
she is not exempt from statutory
qualifications and if someone wants
to enforce Hartigan\[CloseCurlyQuote]s opinion, he or
she could try to do so by filing a quo
warranto petition in circuit court
asking that she be removed from
office. '

THE SAME HARTIGAN opinion
contains two other interesting points:

1. Since the Illinois Supreme Court
has affirmed that supervisor of
assessments can be an elective office,
