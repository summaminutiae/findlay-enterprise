People of Findlay,

| feel it is time to tell the people of this Village what is going to happen to their town
in a very short time if things don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t change. The few businesses that are left are just not
going to be able to survive this winter without your support. | realize that you can drive to
any surrounding town and find any item you want, and sometimes it is necessary. But
why not buy in Findlay, where you live, whenever possible.

Larry Chaney is the local com-

vocational agriculture students to
improve themselves and their

Larry Chaney, Larry Knierim,
Todd Coleman, Jeff Getz and Richard
Waggoner represent the vocational
agriculture department at Findlay
High School on the committee.

They will be contacting area
businessmen and individuals con-
cerning contributions to the Illinois
Foundation FFA. Businessmen and
individuals who want to contribute to
the foundation or need more in-
formation about\[CloseCurlyQuote] the can
contact Brian Wood at FHS,
telephone 758-8521.

Without local people spending their money, the businesses here can't afford to buy
new items, or, in my case, even to restock old items. Utilities, payroll, rent, and high
interest rates on the money I've borrowed to try and keep this business going are more

than my sales each week.

Please stop and think about what will happen without any business in Findlay. How
far will you have to go each time you want to pick up a dozen eggs, some dog food, a
cake mix, or a couple of pork chops for supper? A business must show a profit to
continue. I've been here 5 years and lost money the last 3 years. | don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t care to get rich, |
just would like to be able to operate this business and make a living. Please consider the
alternatives. If not for me, for yourselves.

Sincerely,
Sid King
