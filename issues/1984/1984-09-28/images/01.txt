several farmers dropped the bean heads on their combines and decided soybean crop.

which will be $250,000 in January and
the anticipated issue of new bonds
totalling $660,000 for a ten year
period, the two together will cost
district taxpayers 50% cents more
per $100 of assessed valuation.

School board members had polled
Findlay area residents about their
views on the proposals to upgrade
and rennovate the school buildings.
Almost all responded that they do not
wish to lose the school. There were
only two negative responses, and one
of those came from Shelbyville.

In view of this informal poll, the
school board decided to go with the
life safety survey presented by the
architect, Huff Architectural Group
of Springfield, and get the bonds
organized. tees

There will be no final committment

from the board until all bids for the

hoping the bids will come in at the
cost estimated by the architects.

IN OTHER SCHOOL board action,
unit superintendent Ron Hash gave a

report on State Superintendent
Donald Gill\[CloseCurlyQuote]s financial reports. Hash
said he was pleased with Dr. Gill\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
reformed proposals. \[OpenCurlyQuote]For once, it
was not based on the size of the school

. district . . . of course there is no way

of telling what the legislators will do
with it,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] Hash said.

One of Gill\[CloseCurlyQuote]s proposals is that it be
mandatory for all counties use the
accelerated tax billing and for school
districts to receive their tax monies
within the first quarter of the fiscal
year.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Getting the tax money on time
would save the Findlay school district
lots of interest money . . . we wouldn't
have to use so many tax anticipation
warrants,\[CloseCurlyQuote] Hash related. The Fin-
diay district paid $6,000 in interest
payments last year and would have a
better cash flow to work with if the
tax plan was approved.

Another of Gill\[CloseCurlyQuote]s proposals is to
make state aid payments based on
class size rather than district size.
There would be only one formula used
throughout the state which would

make a student in Findlay worth as
much as one in Champaign as far as
state aid is concerned, Hash said.

Findlay would be fully funded at
the elementary level and could gain
in some areas and lose in others. For
example, Hash pointed out that the
target enrollment for advanced math
is 15, and this year Findlay had nine
students taking that course.

THE SCHOOL BOARD approved
secretarial help for one or two hours a
week for Hash. He told the board that
with the basketball season ap-
proaching and the building project
work, a lot more of his time will be
taken up. --

High school principal Larry
Bradford reported on transportation
problems and on the copy machine at
the high school office. The machine
has a scratched drum. He inquired
about a new machine and leasing a
machine. The matter was tabled until
the October

The board approved the purchase
of a high speed buffer. The machine
will be shared between the high

school and the grade school buildings.

BEFORE THE REGULAR
meeting, 2 budget hearing was held.
The schooi board adopted a budget
for the 1984-85 school year. In ad-
dition, a tax levy resolution was
approved and signed. The budget and
levy were passed without opposition.

The levies for the various funds
are: $430,000 for the education fund,
$104,606 for the building and main-
tenance fund, $24,000 for the tran-
sportation fund, $22,475 for the Illinois
Municipal Retirement Fund, $12,703
for tort immunity, $10,100 for working
cash and $8,300 for the special
education fund.

The total amount levied by the
Findlay School district is $612,184.
Last year the levy was $643,654. Hash
explained that the levy had to go
down because the assessed valuation
dropped by $1,360,392. The district
will be losing $41,685 in local taxes
this year because of the
reassessment.
