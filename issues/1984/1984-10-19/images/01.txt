Also at the was state Rep.
Mike Tate (R-Decatur) who has been

A contract for a feasibility study
and other services from the con-

head of the legally

money becomes available stipulates
that it is to be used to renovate or
expand existing state parks.

The Pannell, Kerr and Forster
study is to be done by Dec. 1 and

availability of the study and of the

po
that Illinois Beach\[CloseCurlyQuote]s lodge has a more
than 65 percent occupancy rate year
around. The rate is kept up he said,
by use of the facility for sales
meetings and conferences by major
corporations during the winter. He
said that Caterpillar is a good

customer for Illinois Beach.
The attraction for these sorts of

He said that repairs are going to be
made at Giant City and Pere
Marquette with part of the \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]soda pop

There are some legal hurdles to be
jumped before any construction
contracts can be signed, Tamminga
said. One is to assure that the DOC
receives $10 million a year from the
soda pop tax regardless of monthly
fluctuations of revenue. Now there is
a lid on the maximum that may be
received in any month and averaging
is not allowed under the terms of the
statute. He also wants to get

legislation approved to allow the
issue of bonds backed by the tax
revenue so that enough money will be

available-for the project in a lump
sum

Both bills are to be introduced in
the legislative session following the
November election.

Hamilton asked that a copy of the
feasibility study be made available to
the Shelbyville Lake Area Tourism
and Economic Development Council
so the lake area business people can
have an idea of what is being
proposed as a new neighbor.

Gordy and Tiberend asked about
such things as sewage treatment and
water. According to Tamminga, the
treatment plant in Wolf Creek is large
enough to handle the proposed load
and this plant is currently connected
to Eagle Creek by an underwater
sewer main. Water supply to both
parks is from the city of Shelbyville.
