Action now is premature

Without much publicity since the
initial announcements were made a
couple of weeks ago, there is con-
siderable activity in connection with a
plan to check out the feasibility of getting
private investors to build a resort and golf
course that would rely on Lake
Shelbyville as a magnet of attraction.

The timing of the announcement in
the face of the Nov. 6 election has caused
some people to raise their eyebrows,
implying that the whole thing is nothing
but a political gambit that will be forgotten
in December. \[OpenCurlyQuote]

But there is also the fact that the
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]soda pop tax\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] passed by. the general
assembly to fund the World\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Fair in
Chicago and to expand McCormick Place
also contains ear-marked goodies for
downstaters as well. The existence of the
money for the feasibility studies is part of
that bill\[CloseCurlyQuote]s effect.

| lt would have been preferable, we
think, for the feasibility study to have
been made before\[CloseCurlyQuote] getting local interests
stirred up. But there also has to be some
evidenced local interest to keep the Dept.
of Conservation on fiotice that people
here think there should be additional
facilities around the lake that will generate
money for the local economy.

As it stands now, there are some
very nice facilities in the Corps and
Conservation campgrounds, but the

people who use the facilities spend very
little in Moultrie or Shelby County. The
workforce to maintain these sorts of
facilities is also limited.

So a resort facility, which is labor
intensive once some staggering capital
costs have been covered, is very attractive
because of the potential to generate a
large cash flow into the area through
salaries paid and goods and services
purchased. ,

The two prime sites for such a facility
are Okaw and Windsor Townships in
Shelby County. Both townships are dry.
Shelby County officials currently find
themselves in the awkward position of
being involved in a court battle because
the county issued a liquor license for use
in what is believed to be a dry township.

. If such a facility is built on® state-
owned or leased lands, a special act of the
General Assembly could solve the
problem, but since there are no
guarantees that the General Assembly
will do anything, it is a bad situation.

Community leaders in Shelbyville,
Findlay and Sullivan have organized and
are prepared to assist in the feasibility
study or in providing information to
prospective builders and operators. But
actually little can be done until the facts
are on the table, and so these committees
may well find themselves with very little to
do for some time.

Letter to the Editor:

I am writing this letter in regard to
our taxes. I realize that everyone's
taxes went up this year. Mine did too!

What I want to say is, we as a
village are always wanting

. For , we
would like to have our roads fixed or
an alley fixed but that can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be done
without money. I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t like paying
taxes anymore than anyone else but

pay.

My mother is on a fixed income and
I know it is hard for her but she
always manages to get by. I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
care what anyone says, there is

im always a way.

We knew from the newspaper for

the past few months that this was
coming so I feel that was the time to
complain and not after it was already
done. The village board meetings are
always open to the public and I feel
that most of the board members know
what they are doing.

I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m glad that David Thurber cared

enough to check into our taxes. I'm

also glad that most of the board
members backed him up. Now for
you two board
the taxes and then signed
I feel you weren't right. After all, you
voted them in. So I feel that you are
just as responsible for- these taxes
ane Aon try to wiggle your way

I also feel that we need a new police
car. I am so thankful that I'can feel
safe. Whenever I need John Love, he
has always been there. e as\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]people
of Findlay don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t really appreciate

Johnny. He does his job.

Also, I think that Mayor Pauline
Briney has done a great job. She has
worked hard for this project at Eagle
Creek State Park and she is not ready
to give up on Findlay.

I am glad that she feels this way
because as long as there is a spark to
get started she will do it. Just because
she is a woman some of you think she
should step down. Well, when election
times comes, I hope she will run
again because I will back her 100
percent.

I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m so glad to be a part of the
village of Findlay. Someday soon |
hope to have my own little business.
I'm not ready for Findlay to die
either.

Be proud of your village and lets all
wire, ceether instead of against each

Charlottee Newman
