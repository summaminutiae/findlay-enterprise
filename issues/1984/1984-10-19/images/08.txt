We again want to express our
appreciation to all of our rain
reporters in Shelby County because it
takes a lot of dedication and effort to
collect this information and report it
timely each week. We also received a
tremendous amount of feedback on
the rain report so it certainly makes
it worthwhile for the effort all these
individuals put into collecting and
reporting this rainfall data each week
during the growing season here in
Shelby County.

Fall Weed Control in Alfalfa

All alfalfa growers should evaluate
the need for a fall weed control
program. Weeds can be controlled
through careful harvest management
and high fertility programs on good
alfalfa stands. But where alfalfa is
thin or not vigorous, weeds have the
opportunity to invade. Specific

herbicides are available to
prevent the invasion of weeds and
help wheat stand to survive and even

regain vigor.

Common weed problems include
sheperd's purse. All these weeds
germinate in the fall and
with alfalfa in late fall, late winter or
early spring.

Alfalfa stands that are less than one
year old may be treated with Kerb,
Furloe, Chioro, IPC or 3.

grains, chickweed, mustard and

after alfalfa becomes dormant in the
fall, but before the soil freezes. Soil
temperatures should be below 60°.
Furloe, Chloro, IPC controls serveral

In the open country where vast expanses of
land stretch on for miles, there are two things
a man can rely on. His compass and his
Wrangler Radial tires. Because Wrangler
all-terrain performance tires will guide your
2 or 4 wheel drive truck, van or RV through
almost anything. They'll give you smooth
driving on the road and Seanad traction

Alfalfa stands more than a year old
gan be treated with these herbicides
or else with Princep, Sinbar, Sencor
or Lexone. All these herbicides are
effective on a broad spectrum of
broadleaved and grassy weeds.

Apply Princep after the last cutting
and before the soil is permanently
frozen. But don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t use Princep on sand
or sandy loam soils. Apply Sinbar in
the fall or spring to dormant alfalfa,
but not when there is snow cover and
not to alfalfa-grass mixtures.
