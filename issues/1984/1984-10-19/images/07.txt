FFA chapter

works at center

The Findlay High School chapter of
Future Farmers of America has been
busy working on the Findlay Com-
munity Center. This work is part of
the Building Our American Com-
munities (BOAC) project that FFA
members participate in each year.

FFA chapter members also painted
the hallway of Findlay High School
leading down to the ag room. The
hallway is now blue and gold for the
FFA colors.

Installing an antenna can be very
dangerous if you don't look up and watch for

power lines.

Should a metal antenna come in contact
with an overhead power line, it could become a
direct pathway for electricity from the overhead
line to you. This could cost you serious injury
_..or even your life.

Avoid climbing or working near overhead
lines. A metal ladder is an excellent conductor
of electricity. Even a wooden ladder, if wet or
contaminated with paint, grease or dirt, can

give you a nasty shock if it makes contact with

an energized power line.

Remember, once on the roof, anything
you're Carrying, whether a CB, TV or radio
antenna -- even metal guttering -- becomes an
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]extended arm\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] that can bring you into contact

with power lines.

For further safety tips about electric lines,
read and follow carefully the detailed instruc-
tions that come with your antenna.

Contact your CIPS office for our free booklet.
