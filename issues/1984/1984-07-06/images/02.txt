It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a good time for parents to talk
to kids about their bicycle riding. So
often lately I've seen them dart
across roads without looking as if
they had the right of way. As far as
most of us are concerned, if we are
fortunate enough to see them in time
we'll be more than willing to give
them the right of way. If you\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve been
driving around town lately you surely
know they're not being as careful as
they should be. Not all of them ride
dangerously. I also see some of them
being very careful to abide by the
rules, but we don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t want to see even
one of them hurt.

I saw so many two unit vehicles go
through town Thursday and Friday
that I supposed all
were full, so Saturday morning I
called the Corps of Engineers Ad-
ministration office to see if they were.
At that time Lithia Springs, Coon
Creek and Bo Wood campgrounds
were full, but there were still spaces
available at Possum Creek, Lone
Point and Whitley Creek. The man I
talked to was Bob Burton, and he said
that he had heard that the state parks
were about 50 percent occupied. This
not being a three day holiday must
have made a difference. I can
remember several years when the
overflows were full on holidays.
Probably a lot of the campers will
come in for the holiday and stay
through next weekend.

I went to Eagle Creek with my
sister and brother in law and a couple
of friends Wednesday evening. I
didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t fish \[OpenCurlyQuote]cause I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have a
license yet. But at one time I watched
four poles while the guys went up to
eat. I didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t touch a pole, but I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m
wondering what would have hap-
pened had I been caught just wat-
ching the poles. Is that against the
law too? I think I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m gonna buy a
license because I sure do like to fish
instead of just watching other
fishermen.

With all the summer leagues

_ playing, the baseball diamond must

be one of the busiest places in town. It
makes me feel good to see so many
Findlay area people interested in the
game, and I appreciate all of the
adults who are so willing to give so
much time to see that Findlay has a
summer league. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m sure there are
times they\[CloseCurlyQuote]d rather be doing other
things. I think the villagers are
catching on to the fact that it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s fun to
go out and see a good game. I believe
there have been more spectators
there this year than in the past. So
grab a lawn chair, go out and sit in
the shade and see our many baseball
players perform. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s so nice to have a
new scoreboard. Before we got it I

\[OpenCurlyQuote]was always running around asking

somebody, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What\[CloseCurlyQuote]sthe score?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] --
It looks like the Community center

is coming along nicely. I think the

outside of the building is looking
great, and I know there\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a lot of work
being done on the inside. I haven't
been in there for the past week or two,
but the last time I was there Brian
Wood and his FFA boys were framing
in the bathrooms. I couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t possibly
name all of them, but I know there\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
been a lot of Findlians donating their
time and talents to the building.
Things seem to be going well there.
One of my favorite dreams would
be to have enough money to buy and
fix up the arches building. I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t look
for that to ever happen, but gosh I
sure would like to see that building
redone. I have a sentimental at-
tachment to that building. I loved it
the first time I ever saw it back in
1940, and I love it still. To me it
wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be Findlay without that

building.

I guess it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a sure thing that the
Eagle Creek Beach won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be open
before Labor Day. All systems are
go, but the dern water stays too high.
Now I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m wondering if we have high
water again next year, will it wash
the beach away?

The city of happiness is located in
the state of mind.

The way to save face is to keep the
bottom half shut.

No person ever impaired their
eyesight by looking on the bright side
of things.
