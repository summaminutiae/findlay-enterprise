Board buys
new police
car Saturday

by Marc Pacatte

Findlay got a new police car
Thursday despite the Village Board\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
decision four months ago to repair the
old car instead of buying a new one.

Board members voted Saturday to
buy a new 1984 Dodge police car for
$10,549 after the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]motor died\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] on the
1976 model, Mayor Pauline Briney
said.

Problems with the old car first
surfaced in March, when the board
decided to have extensive repair
work done instead of buying another
police car.

At that meeting, Village Clerk Mike
Hartman told the board it \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]didn't
need\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] a new car and couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t afford
one anyway.

However, late last week, the police
car quit running, and the board
decided to make the emergency
purchase of a new car at a special
meeting Saturday afternoon.

Hartman was not present at the
meeting. Trustees Dwight Riley and
Ron McClain were also absent when
the car was purchased.

The trustees first met Friday night
to decide what action to take, and
after hearing that the car was beyond
repair decided to check on prices at

Carter and Policeman John Love
reported on car prices.

Briney said the only car the two
found that would have been adaptable
for police use was previously used as
a driver education car.

She added that since the price for
the used car was only $400 lower than
the brand-new, fully-equipped police
car, the board opted to buy the
Dodge.

The price of the car also includes
made the difference in price even less
significant.

Love and village employee Tim
Spellman went to Schaumburg
Thursday to pick the car up and bring
it back to Findlay.

Love had been patrolling the
village on his motorcycle since the
old police car quite running.

Briney added that although the
board had originally wanted to keep
the old car for one or two more years,
buying the new car was a necessity to

keep the town adequately protected
after the old one died.
