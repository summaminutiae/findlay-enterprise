Crowds gathered in Findlay over the Labor Day weekend for the annual
Findlay Days celebration. A lot of people showed up to view the Findlay
. Days Parade on Saturday. In the top row of photographs, Mr. and Mrs.
Morris Nichols, children and grandchildren rode in the parade; one of
the float entries included members of the first and second grade classes
at Findlay Grade School. In the second row of photographs, Mrs.
Bernole Manley was one of the members of the Findlay Fiyets Three
\[OpenCurlyQuote]Wheel Club participating in the parade. Later in the day, mayor Pauline
Briney presented the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Key to Findlay\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] to the director of the Chanute Air
Force Jazz Band prior to that group's performance. Not all Findlay Days
participants were old -- some of the youngsters, including this baby in
this stroller and Lindsay and Ashton Waggoner riding toy cars in the
parade -- enjoyed themselves as well. Other events at Findlay Days
included (bottom row of photographs) a performance by the Findlay
High Schoo! Falconette Pom Pon Squad on Friday evening and a Kiddie
Tractor Pull on Saturday afternoon.
