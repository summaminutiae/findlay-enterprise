One of the main highlights of the Findlay Days celebration -- and the most well attended -- was a Saturday
evening performance by the Chanute Air Force Base Jazz Band. The band drew lots of enthusiastic support
from the crowd. One of the more hilarious events held during Findlay Days was a \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Kiss the Pig\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] contest
sponsored by the Stitch-N-Time 4-H Club. Most of the contestants were worried they would have to kiss the
pig (left photograph) but fortunately, only two, Greg Bohlen (right photo) and John Love had the honor of
kissing the pig, held here by Kelly Smith. There was lots of food served at Findlay Days. In the bottom row of
photographs, Bill Brewer served up some of the beans he cooked for the Masons ham and bean supper held
Saturday evening. The supper was well attended (right photograph). Other events where lots of food was
served were the Findlay Junior Woman\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Club ice cream social on Friday evening and the American Legion
Auxiliary Pancake and Sausage Breakfast Sunday morning.
