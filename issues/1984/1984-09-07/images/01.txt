Miller said. He estimates that
Bethany probably saved between
$18,000 and $20,000 when the district
went from three administrators to
two.

However, there are some costs that
became necessary as a result of the

two administrative positions, he feels
the message to taxpayers is \[OpenCurlyQuote]we're
trying to do something\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] to hold down
costs

One of the ways Miller\[CloseCurlyQuote]s job as
superintendent is made easier is by
the staff. Without that help, he con-
cedes the job would be a lot more

grade school teachers.
He feels that with the new schedule
he will be available more to the grade

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]borderline district\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] -- too many
more students and it wouldn't be
possible to have just two ad-
ministrators; just a few less students
and the cost just couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be justified.

The only other alternative that
Miller sees would be to have a half-
time principal/teacher. There are
other school districts in the state
which have this type of ad-
ministrative staffing.

Having the two different positions
has forced Miller to be well
organized. He admits he isn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t always
as organized as he would like to be,
but having two different jobs in two
different locations has forced some

changes.

One of those changes was the ad-
dition of something as simple as a
briefcase. Miller said that last year
he would want to work on something
and find that part of the material was
at the building where he wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t. As a
concession, he got a briefcase and as
a result that problem isn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t coming up
as often.

He also pointed to the assistance he
gets from his staff. \[OpenCurlyQuote]I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m not always
here to help Norma. . .but she\[CloseCurlyQuote]s ex-
perienced. If I didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have the ex-
perienced people (on staff) my jobs
would be more difficult,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Miller said.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]ONE OF THE biggest drawbacks
is my time,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said. Miller doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
have too much trouble juggling the
two jobs until the winter months when
the schedule of extra curricular
activities steps up and the superin-
tendent has to be on hand for
basketball games.

This gives him a full week, ex-
pecially if there\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a board meeting on
the calendar and other meetings that
may relate to curriculum or changes
