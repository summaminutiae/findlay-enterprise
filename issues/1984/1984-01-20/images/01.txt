One of the persons on hand to greet U.S. Congressman Richard Durbin Friday morning was Findlay Village Board trustee
Dave Thurber. Durbin held a town meeting in Findlay Friday to express his views on several issues and to get the opinions
of local residents on federal legislation. The Marines in Lebanon, the federal deficit and utility rates were the more popular
topics. The Findlay meeting was Durbin's 68th since taking office.

Durbin told the crowd that he doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
want to see more Marines lost. He
believes that they should be based on air

fact that we're not going to turn the

Durbin is not optimistic that Lebanon
can work out its problems. \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]At the very

Democrats feel the same way.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

ON THE SUBJECT of the federal

Lakeside
asks ICC
for 61 %
increase

Lakeside Telephone Company will
a request with the Illinois Comm
Commission for a 61 percent increas
local service charges. The company has
not requested an increase since 1969.

According to company officials, part of
the increase can be attributed to the
financial picture of Lakeside. Dwight
Zimmerman, vice president of Lakeside,
said that the past 11 months have been a
difficult period for the company and that
the rate case \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]has to be based on
historical information.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Zimmerman, Bill Capel, also a vice
president, and Joe Little, plant
superintendent for Lakeside, met with
Findlay mayor Pauline Briney and
village trustee Dave Thurber Monday to
explain the company\[CloseCurlyQuote]s reasons for the
proposed rate hike.

Zimmerman told village officials that
the company will attempt to break even
with the proposed increase. The com-
pany cannot afford to continue to provide
toll free calling, and a flat rate will be
added to the bill of every telephone
customer.

This means no more free calls to
Shelbyville and Kirksville for Findlay
residents. The company proposes in-

creasing that portion of the bill from --

nothing to $2.50 per month.

However, in exchange for the ad-
ditional surcharge, the telephone
company will pledge to upgrade those
lines that have been toll free. Zim-
merman explained that since those were
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]free\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] calls, the company could not
afford to upgrade and maintain those

properly in the past. No revenue
in to pay the expenses of
and ugrading.
With the new surcharge, that money
will be used to upgrade those lines, and
Findlay telephone customers should see
a difference in the future when calling
Shelbyville and Kirksville.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We know that service is not as good as
it should be . . . the commitment we are
making in this rate case is, if the Com-
merce Commission grants the $2.50,
whatever circuits are needed we'll put

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]THE FCC DECIDED to make a lot of
changes in the business,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

| telephone
Zimmerman said. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Up to now long
distance calls have been profitable. (The
calls) have been used to subsidize local

formation lately about the cost of toll
calls going down is a lot of
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]propaganda\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. He said that the only toll
calls that will decrease in cost are
calls between states.

Telephone calls within the state (these
are also considered toll calls) have
already increased. He pointed to a $1.89
extended area service charge which was
granted to Illinois Bell by the ICC ef-
fective Jan. 1.
