To tell the truth I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m 80 relaxed !'m
hardly thinking. Nevertheless, I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m er
joying the vreat Florida weather, and
that was onc reason | really wanted to
come here. Three of my sisters are here,

and Kathy and barry are here for ten
Jays so it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a lot like being home, and |
don't miss the snow and ice. Had I stay ec
home | probaly would have been house
JOUNG

[wo days betore | started this trip | fell
and hurt my lett foot. I still can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t get a

shoe on so it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s good I'in in a warm
climate. It makes me furious at myself
for the wav I hurt my foot, I was super
careful outside because it was so slick.
Then I jumped out of a chair to answer
the telephone and my foot was asleep.
For one evening I crawled on all fours
and walked on my knees. Once I went to

as few as possible. But now it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s getting so
much better I think I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll soon be walking

normally.

I just talked to another sister in
Illinois, and she\[CloseCurlyQuote]s coming out so we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll no
doubt have a family reunion while we're
here. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m looking foward to it.

I had grapefruit this morning from a
big tree that my mom planted from a
seed in Illinois and raised it to a fair sized
tree, then transplanted it in my sister\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
yard. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a beautiful tree, and of course,

re,
iY lorida has clauned a freeze of citrus
ruil and the prices went up. This is the
irst year | could see real damage and

believe me \Uiey lost not only fruit but
probably millions of trees. This year
citrus fruit and juices will no doubt be
very high and with good reason.

I sure wish I could get a Decatur paper
here. I miss seeing the score on Findlay
baligames, But I'll have to wait for an
Enterprise. | really look forward to that
so I can keep abreast with what\[CloseCurlyQuote]s going
on at home. I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know why it takes so
long to get here, but I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t usually get it
untul Tuesday or Wednesday,

I just wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t in the right place to write
a column for last v 2ek. I arrived at my
sisters on Monday. I didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t bring a
typewriter because I knew she had one.
The only problem was that her son in
Tampa had borrowed it. So by the time I
found one it was too late to get it there by
the Thursday deadline.

Maybe you can all thank me for
leaving. At least the weather got warmer
there. We left in -15 degree weather, and
in a couple of days I noticed it was in the

30\[CloseCurlyQuote]s and 40\[CloseCurlyQuote]s there. I hope a lot of that

dumb snow got away.

A friend offered to pick me up at
Kissimmee and bring me to Arcadia in a
small plane, but since I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m not too fond of
big planes and never having ridden in a
small one, I was happy to have my sister
come to get me in an automobile. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m a
born coward.

My sisters are out walking to keep in
shape, and I resent the fact that about all
I can do is hobble around the house.
Maybe next week I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll make it.
