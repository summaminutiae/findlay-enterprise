eis debate

Controversy about whether Findlay
needed to buy a new police car
sparked heated debate among village dealer
officials Monday night.

One trustee, Dwight Riley, charged
the purchase seemed like a \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]shady
deal\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] because he, village clerk Mike
Hartman and trustee Ron McClain
were not present at the meeting.

However, trustee Dave Thurber
said all board members were in-
formed of the meeting and its purpose
and had an equal opportunity to at-
tend.

Riley said it seemed as though the
board \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]waited until you had the
chance when Mike and I were gone.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
Although Hartman does not have a
vote, he had been critical of pur-
chasing a new police car. |

Mayor Pauline Briney said to
Riley, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I resent you calling it a shady
deal: As far as I know we didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t do
anything
is not the place for discussion; it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
already been decided by the majority
of the board.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

The discussion began while the
board was scanning the list of bills to
be paid, and Riley said, \[OpenCurlyQuote]What I'd
like to know is, how'd we get a car?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Trustee George Carter explained
the events leading up to the board\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
decision June 30 to buy the new car
and told Riley that the problem with
the old car could be anything from a
blown gasket to a burned up engine.

Riley said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You mean to tell me
we went and bought a new car
without even knowing what\[CloseCurlyQuote]s wrong
with the old one?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Thurber said it was \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]an emergency
situation,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and the board felt the
purchase was the best way to handle
the problem.

The car had been a source of
trouble for policeman John Love, who
told the board that out of three trips
he had taken to Shelbyville for court,
twice he had to have the car towed.
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What if there was a wreck out on

_ 128, and someones life depended on

it?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Love said.
The board bought a 1984 Dodge

from a Schaumburg dealer who had
ordered the cars while anticipating
being awarded the contract for state
police cars, which went to a Chevrolet

Send member John Diss told Riley
that after the board had checked with
dealers in Shelbyville, it decided to
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]spend a few thousand more and get
the police package and warranty.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

The purchase price -- $10,449 --
was only $400 lower than one of the
used cars available in Shelbyville.

Hartman said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Does anybody
actually know what\[CloseCurlyQuote]s wrong with the
old one?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]

Carter again replied, \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]It could be a
blown gasket or a burned up engine.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Riley said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You mean we spent
$10,000 when it could have only been
$100 to repair the car.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Trustee Larry Rodman countered,
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]This time, though,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] referring to
past repair bills. |

Hartman said, \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]What if it ran for
the next three years without a

9"

Rodman said the board had to be
concerned about \[OpenCurlyQuote]the safety of the
village.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He and Hartman exchanged
some more comments, Rod-
man asked, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]How much did we bury
in that old red thing?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] referring to a
village truck which the board had
spent a lot on repair work.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I don't care,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] Riley said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]the
people we're supposed to be
respresenting are raising hell about
--

Riley said the board was doing \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]big
town spending with hick town
money.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Rodman said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t appreciate
him coming here as an angry tax-
payer or angry board member when
he had the opportunity to come here\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
when the purchase took place.

The board transferred $4,000 from
revenue sharing to the general fund
to pay for the car, with Riley casting
the lone \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]no\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] vote.

Briney said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]Well, I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m glad we got
a new police car,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and that she had
received positive comments from
residents about the purchase.

Station wagon, boat trailer
end up in Lake Shelbyville

by Pauline Briney

Six families from Chanute Field
spent some anxious moments Sunday
morning when a 1976 Mercury station
wagon and a boat trailer slipped into
Lake Shelbyville at the Eagle Creek
boat ramp. The incident occurred
about 10:35 a.m.

The vehicle gear was in \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]park,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
and the vehicles seemed to just slide
into the water. The boat evidently
floated off the trailer and a very
small boy, probably about eight, on
board drove it into shore with
directions from his father.

Frosty Herron, a Shelby County
Sheriff's Deputy, was in the area at
the time and was helpful in directing
traffic and the large crowd that soon
arrived at 11:05 to assist, and the
Shelby County Rescue squad arrived
on the scene about 11:40 a.m.

Divers Fred Hopkins and Larry

Reynolds brought the station wagon
and trailer out of the water about
12:30 p.m. While diving they hooked a
cable from Bud Wheeler\[CloseCurlyQuote]s wrecker to
the car, and it was soon back on the
ramp, thoroughly soaked of course.

Many boats were waiting to be
launched and others waiting to come
in. At one time more than 30 boats
were in the area, their passengers
watching the recovery.
