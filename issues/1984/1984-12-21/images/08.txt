CHRISTMAS CARD CASH FOR CANCER

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]tt is our privilege to wish you, our friends and neighbors, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]MERRY
CHRISTMAS\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and let you know that Instead of sending Christmas cards, we
have sent a donation to the American Cancer Society for research. We hope
this meets with your approval and perhaps you, too, will want to join in the
campaign to eradicate one of the most devastating maladies of mankind.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR!
