we'd have had at least six more weeks of

According to the Rev. Curtis Eaker the

It is entitled \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Those were the Days.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
Ah for the good old days of the nineteen
hundreds

Those were the days of the mighty trusts
when the tycoons roared and thun-

dered,

When a laborer worked 12 hours a day
and got a buck for his toil, ;
And a farmer\[CloseCurlyQuote]s gain for a year\[CloseCurlyQuote]s hard
_ work scarce paid for the use of his

soil.
Ah for the Good Old Days, from nineteen
twenty, --

*

The days of \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]cooties\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and poison gas and
miserable years in trenches,

And a veteran\[CloseCurlyQuote]s reward was a hungry gut
and a bed on a park\[CloseCurlyQuote]s hard benches.
Ah for the Good Old Days, Those days

when the twenties roared,
When the gangster prowled while his gun

moll primped,

And the bootlegger fattened his hoard.
Those were the days of the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Tommy
Gun,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] of Flappers and jellie beans,

Of speakeasy

ag Ne irate

thirty nine.
When Hitler crowed from his beer hall
stoop and planned the Siegfried Line,
When Britain and France sold the sinews
of war to add to the Nazis might,

And the USA proclaimed itself \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]A nation
too proud to fight.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]

And Roosevelt promised, \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]No Yank shall
die in a war in a foreign land,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

And one year later we went to war, just
as our leaders had planned.

Ah for the Good Old Days, the days after
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]forty one\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

The snéak attack

And sunken ships and an army on the
run.

Corregidor, Attu, The Coral Sea and
thousands of young lives lost.

Of victory and treason and friends turned
foe and peace at a terrible cost.

We traded Hitler for Stalin\[CloseCurlyQuote]s reign, a
difference too small to see,

And lifted neither voice nor hand to keep
half of Europe free. :
Ah for the Good Old Days, the fifties

serene and calm,
The war in Korea, the Chinese hordes
and the Reds with the Atom Bomb.

The fight to the Yalu, the foes collapse, fries,

the enemy on the run,

And Mr. Truman fired the man who had
the conflict won. :
Ah for the Good Old Days, the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]Sixties\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]
that passed so soon. |
The missile crisis, the Bay of Pigs, the
man we put on the moon. ;
The president murdered and Reverend
King, the students who looted and

burned,
and honor and loyalty spurned.
Ah for the'Good Old Days, the seventies,
from afar.
