for the dance which was held at the

Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t let anyone tell you,
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]All banking costs are alike.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

THEY\[CloseCurlyQuote]RE NOT!

Not all banks offer the same services; not all banks service their customers as well; and not all charges are
alike. :

AND. THAT\[CloseCurlyQuote]S THE TRUTH!

Shop for your bank as you would anything else. Ask them how much it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s going to cost you to do business with
them. Check out what their charges are to maintain a checking account, the cost of an overdraft and the like.

And do your banking where you get the best deal!

At Shelby County State Bank we want to do business with you in a way that maintains our financial security
with the least possible cost to you. We want to provide the maximum degree of financial services that do you, our
customer, the most good and provide you with the maximum convenience at the lowest cost. (That's one of the
reasons we installed BANK 724, for banking 7 days a week, 24 hours a day.)

There is a difference in bar.king. Just ask us and we'll show you how much we can save you just by providing
better services at lower prices.
