Findlay will have a beach in two years.
Well, we\[CloseCurlyQuote]re still waiting and hoping that

some good promotional ideas, and I think
in time the Lake area can become more
of what it was supposed to be in the first

place.
One of the members and his wife said

three had ever heard of Lake Shelbyville.
Well, if nobody knows it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s here they ain\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
gonna come.

As I understand it the organization has
been refused permission to place signs
anywhere on Interstate 57. There\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a
ruling that signs can be placed only for
places just 10 miles from the Interstate.
Maybe they need to change that law. All
in all I think the reorganization of the

Lake Shelbyville is here to stay so we
might as well make the best of it. Join the
club. It only costs 10 bucks.

I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m writing this column on Sunday
which by the way is another lousy day.

trying to see a bit of both of them. When
did college basketball start Sunday

games anyway? It must have been very

recently. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m hoping Illinois will win over

Indiana. I know who is gonna win the |

other game. The donkeys are.

Since we had the misfortune to lose two
Findlay students in eight days I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m
becoming paranoid. Everytime I hear of
a 10-50 on the scanner I say a little prayer
that no Findlians are involved.

Lloyd Wright said he saw a woolly
worm last week that was black as coal
and if that means more bad weather he\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
gonna squash the next one he sees.

The primary election will be held
March 20 so mark your calendar now. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d
like to see every eligible voter in Findlay
make it to the polls. I can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t say how you
should vote, but I do believe it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s your
civic duty to vote. ;

Somebody called me late one evening
last week and asked if she could have a
few minutes of my time for a political
poll. Those few minutes turned into more
like an hour. I wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]thave begrudged a
few minutes, but I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t like talking on

didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t mind telling, but she didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t tell me
hers. So I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know if I made somebody
happy or unhappy.

I didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have to run up and down
Division Street Sunday between taking
pictures of the donkey basketball game
and watching the Illinois-Indiana game
after all. George Carter said he wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
interested in the ballgame so he fook the
pictures. After the game I found they
announced the Illinos game scores at the
donkey basketball game so I wish I'd
gone after all. I hear they had lots of fun,
and I think from what I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve heard the
audience and the donkeys had more fun
than the riders. I guess one of the riders
ripped his pants. (Can they be fixed
Bobby Mowry?) and a young lady was a
bit embarrassed when her donkey pot-
tied on the floor, and she had to be a

super pooper scooper.

My mother-in-law has put three ar-

Eielson not EULSON.

In the future I would like to see it
