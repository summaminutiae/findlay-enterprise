a.m. Monday, April 2. The staff will
attempt to schedule children at the
convenience of the parents, Walters
stated. Screening hours will be from 9
a.m. to 12 p.m. Afternoon sessions will be
held from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m.

According to Walters, the géal of the
Findlay school district is to reach 100
percent of all the school district\[CloseCurlyQuote]s pre-
school children between the ages of three
and five. To schedule a child for a pre-
school screening session, the parents
should contact the Findlay Grade School
office at 756-8544.

In addition to the screening, pre-
kindergarten registration will be held the
week of April 2 through April 6 for the
1984-85 school year. At the time a child is
registered, a birth certificate should be
presented at the grade school office.
Parents will also receive physical papers
at this time. All children entering kin-
dergarten must have a physical
examination and up-to-date im-

munizations.
Children may be registered for kin-
dergarten at the pre-school screening
in the United Methodist Church
basement on April 2. Birth certificates
should be presented at this time.

Acid rain legislation unjustified,

CIPS official tells committee

Any cost borne by customers of Central
Iilinois Public Service Co. to reduce
sulfur dioxide emissions which allegedly
impact the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]acid rain\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] phenomenon
would be totally unjustified in light of the
scientific uncertainty that exists today,
according to Richard J. Grant, manager
of Environmental Affairs for CIPS.

Grant made the statement Monday,
March 5 as part of his testimony at a
hearing before a subcommittee of the
House Energy..and Commerce Com-
mittee in Chicago. The hearing was
related to House Bill 3400, sponsored by

Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA).

CIPS customers would face at least a
10 percent increase in the cost of electric
service if the acid rain control proposal
currently before Congress is enacted,
according toGrant. -

Grant said the bill would require the
installation of sulfur dioxide \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]scrub-
bers\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] at 50 power stations in the United
States, including CIPS\[CloseCurlyQuote] station in Cof-
feen. Approximately 90 percent of the
costs would be funded by a nationwide
fee of one-tenth of a cent per kilowat-
thour on most electricity usage.

The fans just loved the action Sunday afternoon as four teams competed in the
annual Donkey Basketball game sponsored by Findlay\[CloseCurlyQuote]s emergency medical
technicians. Competing were teams composed of the EMT's, firemen, Jaycees
and senior basketball boys and the faculty of Findlay High School. Basketball
players (!?!) spent a lot of time off the donkeys -- much to the delight of the
audience. +

until additional research is completed.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The majority of CIPS customers, 58
percent, believe more research should be
conducted to determine the causes and
effects of acid rain before any corrective
action is taken,\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] Grant said. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Only 11
percent believe immediate action
requiring contol measures should be
taken by Congress.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Grant said the responses were con-
tained in a survey of CIPS customers
conducted by Central Surveys, Inc. of
Shenandoah, Iowa, in July 1983.

The survey results showed that fewer
than nine percent of CIPS customers
were willing to pay $5 or more per month
to further reduce sulfur dioxide
emissions, Grant added.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It simply has not been scientifically
proven that sulfur dioxide emissions
from CIPS\[CloseCurlyQuote] generating facilities have
any deleterious effects in the Nor-
theastern United States or, for that
matter, any place in the world,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] he said.
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Only if and when such information
exists, should CIPS customers be asked
to pay for additional control equipment.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

The testimony asserts that over the 10
years, 1970 to 1980, sulfur dioxide
emissions in Illinois were reduced 36
percent, and an additional 13 percent
reduction is expected in the current
decade.

Grant stated that CIPS does not believe
enough is known about acid rain to adopt
a control program.

\[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]We support a research strategy which
includes remedial mitigation efforts such
as lake liming and fish re-stocking
programs in the areas alleged to be ef-
fected,\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] he said. \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]The alternative is to
spend billions of dollars of electric
ratepayers\[CloseCurlyQuote] money on a large-scale
experiment in which the benefits could
fail to justify the costs.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]

CIPS provides electric service to
307,000 customers in 551 communities in
a 20,000-square-mile region of central
and southern Illinois. Virtually all
electricity generated by CIPS is
produced with coal. In 1983, about 83
percent of that coal was mined in Illinois,
and the balance in Kentucky and In-
diana.
