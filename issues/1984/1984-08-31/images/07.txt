Durbin says lake plans good

Congressman Dick Durbin (D-
Springfield) Friday had good things
to say about the possible use of the
State soda pop tax for enhancement of
recreational opportunities on Lake
Shelbyville and also praised the
formation of a group to tout the
benefits of the facility.

But he also demonstrated con-
siderable lack of knowledge about the
current and planned management
practices on the federal reservation.

Gerald Gordy, an officer of the
Lake Shelbyville Boosters, asked
Congressman Durbin if he knew what
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
does with the revenue it obtains from
the public camp grounds it operates.
Durbin said he did not, but that he
would attempt to find out and provide
Gordy with the information.

The question and answer session
between Gordy and Rep. Durbin
came as part of a town meeting
session held Friday morning at the
AmBuC Hall.

Other questions were on such topics
as the future of veteran\[CloseCurlyQuote]s job training
programs, diversion of funds from
the Social Security System, and
federal employees being out of the
Social Security System.

Durbin said that job training

programs have fallen from one
percent of the gross national product
at the time the WWII GI Bill was in
effect to about three percent of that
level.

The rumor that Social Security
funds have been diverted has been
going around for years, but it has no
basis in fact, Durbin said. He in-
dicated that any attempt to make
such a move would create a massive
crisis not only in Washington but
throughout the country.

And all new federal employees,
including members of Congress, will
soon be under the Social Security
System. This will tend to lessen the
effect of federal employees \[OpenCurlyQuote]double
dipping\[CloseCurlyQuote] from both the federal
retirement system and Social
Security.

Prior to the question and answer
session, Rep. Durbin . briefed the
Sparse group on the recom-
mendations of the Grace Com-
mission. The commission, headed by
industrialist Peter Grace, was
charged with finding ways to cut
costs in the federal government and
to make the federal establishment
run more smoothly and efficiently.
