Village board adopts tax levy,
allows use of village hall

A tax levy of $39,950 for the 1984-85
fiscal year was approved by the
Findlay Village Board Monday night.
The annual tax levy ordinance was up
only slightly from the figure ap-
proved last year.

For the 1983-04 fiscal year, the
board had approved a tax levy or-
dinance of $38,052. The new levy is
just $1,898 over last year\[CloseCurlyQuote]s. According
to village attorney Chris Eber-
spacher, the increase is \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]negligible\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
or less than one-tenth of one percent
on tax bills.

The largest item in the ordinance

$<
:

insurance; $2,150 for the audit; $1,350
for working cash; $1,850 for police
protection; $200 for emergency
services and disaster operations:
$590 for the school crossing guard:
and $550 for chlorination of sewage.
The complete ordinance appears
elsewhere in the Enterprise.

The ordinance was approved by a 5-
0 vote. Trustee Larry Rodman did not
attend the meeting.
