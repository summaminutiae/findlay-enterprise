about a disputed tax levy, Mrs.
Briney has reversed herself and told
the protestors they were off the
agenda for the regular monthly
meeting.

At the special meeting, the three
spokesmen for the protestors, Donna
Wildman, Pat Rodman and Juanita
Haycraft, asked several questions
which Mrs. Briney and board
member Dave Thurber admitted they
couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t answer, but the attorney
could.

It was at this meeting that the
protestors asked the board to fire
Eberspacher. Mrs. Briney told them
that he was not even aware the board

was holding a special meeting, and

' She felt Eberspacher should be

present to answer questions and
defend himself.

At this point, she offered to bring
Eberspacher in for a special meeting
Oct. 29. The , concerned
about the additional cost, offered to
ask their questions at the next

---- regular meeting, Nov. 12.

However, since that time, Mrs.
Briney has reversed her position. She
told Mrs. Haycraft and Mrs. Rodman
that they are off the agenda for the
regular meeting Monday night.

The tax protestors will hold their
own meeting, however, at 7 p.m.
Monday, Nov. 12 at the Findlay Fire
Station. Findlay taxpayers are in-
vited to attend this meeting and learn
what the protestors have discovered
about the disputed tax levy.
