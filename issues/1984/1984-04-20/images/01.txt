Cribbet receives special award
at 42nd annual alumni banquet

Nearly 300 persons looked on as
John Edward Cribbet received the
first Findlay High School
Distinguished Alumni Award at the
42nd annual Findlay alumni banquet
Saturday night.

Cribbet, the Chancellor of the
University of Illinois, is a graduate of
the Findlay High School Class of 1936.
Six fellow classmates joined in
honoring Cribbet at the banquet.

The award was presented to
Cribbet by Lewis Coleman, a
member of the Findlay school board.
In presenting the award, Coleman
told the crowd a little of Cribbet\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
ba

Following high school graduation,
Cribbet attended Illinois Wesleyan
University where he graduated in
1940. He entered the University of
Illinois to study law, but was in-
terrupted by World War II. After
being discharged from the Army,
Cribbet returned to the U. of I. to
complete his law studies.

A brief stint as an attorney in
private practice was followed by
Cribbet returning to the University as
a professor of law. He eventually
became the Dean of the Law School.
In addition, as Coleman pointed out,
Cribbet has served as a visiting
professor both in the United States
and abroad. He is also the author of
several law books.

Cribbet and his wife, Betty, have
two daughters and five grand-
children.

Coleman also read a_ student
evaluation by one of Cribbet\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Fin-
diay teachers, A.F. Baker. Baker
called Cribbet \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]an apt pupil... witha
thirst for learning.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He pointed out
that Cribbet was a natural leader and
that he was a member of the

_ basketball team.

Baker also explained in his
evaluation that Cribbet\[CloseCurlyQuote]s father had
died when he was very young and that
he was raised by his mother \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]who
had a strong influence . . . she did a

grand job of raising him.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]

A second part of the presentation of
the Distinguished Alumni Award was
made by fellow members of the Class
of 1936. Acting as spokesman for the
group, Darrell Wall of California, told
the audience that \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]we knew him

Wall had brought along scveral
momentos from the past including a
Christmas card which showed that
Cribbet was a \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]lousy speller\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and a
book which he had autographed
which showed he was a \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]lousy writer
too!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Wall said that he had a list of the
goals and ambitions of all the
members of the Class of 1936. Crib-
bet's ambition was to be a newspaper
correspondent, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]he was a total
failure at his ambition,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Wall
quipped.

In his acceptance speech, Cribbet
started out by saying, \[OpenCurlyQuote]I am not naive
enough to believe all the nice things
being said about me tonight . . . but
they sure make me feel good.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

He thanked everyone for their
comments and noted Baker\[CloseCurlyQuote]s com-
ments about his sports ability, con-
sidering \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]that I was the ninth man on
the nine man squad.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]

Cribbet told the audience that his
was the last class to graduate from
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]old\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Findlay High School that they
\[OpenCurlyQuote]never had the opportunity to study
in this new building.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Hé*also said
that they were priviledged to have \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]a
great collection of teachers\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and
finished by complementing the
education he received at Findlay
High School.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]At no stage have I been the least
bit inhibited by the quality of
education I got in Findlay ... I am
deeply honored to receive this
(award).\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Spring really has arrived, although with cold, wet temperatures not everyone is convinced. Spring flowers
have started blooming all around town, incluidng these daffodils and hyacinths. With a little bit of luck, trees
should be sprouting new green leaves during the next few weeks.
