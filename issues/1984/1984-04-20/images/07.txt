The Baptist Youth Group
wishes to thank all those who
contributed to the Diane Kay
Reed Memorial Fund. She was
our ray of sunshine and always a
sparkle in the group. She has
been sadly missed these past few
weeks. Yet our hope is we can
continue to do the loving, caring
and dedicated work of the Lord
Diane had started. This poem
reminds us so much of the one we
loved.

We had an angel and didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know
it

She hurried through life in a
breathless sort of
way

She touched this one and that one
in her short life

span
Like a candle burning wildly and
then flickering
out too soon
For one brief, shining hour she
warmed so many
with that glow
Again thank you,
In God's Love,
The Findlay Baptist Youth
Group
