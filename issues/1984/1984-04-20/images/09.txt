You'll smile too when
you see how a heat
pump saves energy!

Most heating systems cost mare to operate because
they have to create heat. The heat pump simply moves
heat already in the air from one place to the other.

in winter, it actually warms your home by gathering
heat that exists in cold outside air. In summer, it becomes
an air conditioner, removing heat from air inside your
home to keep you cool.

The heat pump is highly efficient, too. It produces
about two units of heating energy for every unit of electric
energy it uses.

So, if you're replacing your heating system, or building
a new home, consider the heat pump for efficient,
economical year-round comfort. For more information
contact your CIPS office for our booklets, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Amazing
Heat Pump,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Pump Up Savings:\[CloseCurlyQuote]
