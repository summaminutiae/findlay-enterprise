to be a part of it.
Hash pointed out for instance that all

students who go out for basketball may
not be on the varsity team, but that
students will see some action during the
course of the season.

Such is not the case at a larger school
where students are cut from teams
where they \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]take only the best, while we

the passage of a tax referendum.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]A lot of the success is due to the fact

to do what is best for all students in the
