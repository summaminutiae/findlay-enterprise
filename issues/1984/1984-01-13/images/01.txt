Some fishermen never give up their favorite sport -- even when the water of Lake Shelbyville is a \[OpenCurlyQuote]frozen sheet of ice.
Using ultralight tackle, the ice fisherman goes for pan fish which still feed in the chilled waters. The shoreline of the lake is
covered with ice floes that show how much the level of Lake Shelbyville has fallen since the mid-December deep freeze

started.

The village board went into an
illegal session Monday night to
discuss measures to take about overtime

Dear Ryhard and Yin Spebenon
Pauline - Briney said the
problem has been building each month,

THE PROBLEM DATES back several
months when former supervisor
Bill Rankin resigned from that post to
seek a similar position in Sullivan. The
board decided at that time not to replace

Since Rankin left, Mrs. Briney pointed
out, overtime hours have increased each

During the recent bad weather, Todd\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
Point township road crews cleared the
north side of Findlay and Thurber said,

The board took no action and will
continue to have the townships plow
village streets.

FOR THE SECOND TIME in less than
four months, a hearing was held to
terminate utility service at the Don
Nolan home at 203 N. Dazey. The service
was terminated for non-payment of
$62.74 for utility service during October.

As during the past meeting, Nolan was
not present for the hearing. The

Eberspacher, and the motion to ter-

gas, water and sewer service.

requiring a utility deposit was discussed.
The board also reviewed a possible plan
to charge customers (on a sliding scale)
