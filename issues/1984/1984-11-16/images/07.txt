Photographer Brian Nichols found
this deer, a fawn of this year, near
Sullivan. But with deer hunting
season starting Friday, Nichols is
being as close-mouthed about the
location as a mushroom hunter.
All .government property lands
except park ground and waterfowl
refuge areas will be open to hunters
this weekend, starting a half an
hour before sunrise to sunset
Friday. The second weekend will
be Dec. 7-9, according to
Department of Conservation site
manager Ted Anderson, who also
said the county deer population
appears to be even larger than last
year. More than 90 deer, a county
high, were bagged last season.

Electricity. It's something you can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t see or smell or
hear. Yet, like everything else you buy, electricity is a
manufactured product. It takes people, machinery and

fuel to make electricity.

So, even though we sometimes take electricity for
granted, it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s really no different than other products we

use everyday .. . like food and clothing.

So use electricity wisely, because how you choose
to use it determines how much you'll spend for it.

Electricity
It'S the Power
of Choice.
