Consider Windbreak for Your Farm

Once harvest is out of the way,
make plans for a windbreak on your
farm

The key decision about windbreaks
is selection of the right species tu do
the job.

Evergreens make the best wind-
break because they hold their foliage
during winter when protection is
most needed. Norway spruce and
Douglas fir are the ones we usually
recommend for Shelby County.

Spruce and firs form a fairly tight
barrier because of their dense
branching pattern. Pines grow more
rapidly and offer quick protection,
but their branching is more open,
allowing wind to blow through.
