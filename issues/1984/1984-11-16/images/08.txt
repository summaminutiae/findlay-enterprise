4-H news -_

by David W. Allen
Diane L. Myatt
Extension Advisers, County

Les and Annabelle Robertson of
Tower Hill returned home last week
from Washington, D.C., where they
attended a National +H Volunteer
Leader Forum/Horse at the National
4-H Center. Les and Annabelle were

two of forty delegates from

therapeutic horseback
programs; horse judging
safety techniques and equipment;
horse show management; careers in
the horse industry; programming
ideas; teaching oral reason ter-
minology to horse judging teams;
and preparing effective demon-
strations.

Both Les and Annabelle said the
parts of these
workshops and sessions were the
exchange of ideas with other club
leaders during each discussion
period, learning how to teach the 4
H\[CloseCurlyQuote]ers how to give oral reasons in
horse judging, and teaching how to
give demonstrations.
