Controlled blaze

by Cosetee ®.¢ Cruit

The Findlay vi village board ap-
proved a request to purchase new
radios for the Findlay pelice car at its
meeting Monday night. The request
was made by policeman John Love.

The Regency radios, both high
band and low band, cost $741. Both
radio bands are needed because the
Shelby County and Macon County
Sheriff's departments are on low
band and all other emergency ser-
vices, such as the fire and ambulance
department are on high band.

The village had previously been

David Thurber.

Mayor Pauline Briney said that
because \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]some people made some
bad publicity with David\[CloseCurlyQuote]s com-
pany,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] the radios were pulled a few

Volunteer firefighters of the Findlay Fire Protection District braved the
wind and cold Sunday morning to purposely set a fire to provide plenty
of smoke and then burn this house and buildings to the ground. This was
no case of arson. The owners of the house and adjacent buildings
(located just east of Findlay) wanted these frame structures demolished,

ee clearly at the meeting that
Thurber didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t work for the sales
division of this firm and in no way
would benefit from the sale of these
radios.

She also stated that the board had
recieved \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]bad press\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] about the police
car radios. She did not specify how or
where the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]bad press\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] a

DURING A DISCUSSION about the
need for the new radios, Love said
just before the meeting he got into a
situation where the radios would have
made the difference in him going in
the wrong direction when he received
a call about a car wreck.

The car wreck, east of Findlay on
the Findlay road, had
involved injuries. When Love
received the call he headed south of
town, only to be redirected east.

Findlay fire fighter Charlotte
Newman told the board \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]tonight we
needed him and didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have any way

to reach him.\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] Without the high band
radio, the Findlay Fire and Am-
bulance Dept. has no way to com-
municate with Love.

Love also clarified why he goes out
of the jurisdiction of Findlay to work
at the scene of accidents. When there
is a wreck with injuries and he is the
closest police officer; he is usually
assigned by the Shelby County
Sheriff\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Office to render assistance
until the appropriate law en-
forcement officer arrives. He said he
has covered wrecks as far away as
Dalton City and would continue to do
so when there are injuries.

Love flatly stated \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]after tonight I
will refuse to go out on any calls
without a radio.\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] He said the sheriff
told him it was more dangerous to go
out without a gun than it was to go out
without a radio since he couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t call
for assistance.

and it gave the volunteer firefighters a chance for some real training.
They were hoping to fill the house with smoke to give firefighters the
opportunity to use methods they had been and were being taught to go

into the possibility of obtaining a
grant to purchase the radios.

A CITIZEN AT the meeting, Evaun
Lynch, asked about the old police
radio. That radio was in bad shape
when the village board decided to
purchase a new police car. Love said
he had trouble several times with
communications between himself
and the sheriff's office.

In addition, that radio was only a
low band which meant he could not
communicate with the fire and
ambulance department.

Trustee David Riley first
questioned the need to advertise for
bids for the police radio, but then
decided that was not a good idea
because of the high cost of ad-
vertising. Earlier in the meeting the
board approved bills for $313.74 for
the Decatur Herald & Review (to hire
a new employee); $174.50 to Mid-
Illinois Newspapers (to hire a new

employee); $81.84 to the Shelbyville
Daily Union (to hire a new em-
ployee); and $17.92 to Best
Newspapers (Findlay ) to
advertise for bids for the old police
car.

Love told him (Riley) that he had
already checked with several area
firms and that the $741 price was the
best price possible.

representatives Miké Oldham and

motion to mark the Findlay police car

to install bar lights on the car.

Tax who spoke at the
last three Findlay Village Board
meetings and were ruled off the
agenda Monday night by mayor
Pauline Briney may have gotten the

here.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Actually, the tax protestors
spoke only one hour at the first
meeting and approximately 14 hours
at the third meeting.

Briney also told Wildman that if the
protestors had any more questions
they should have their attorney
contact the village attorney.

At this point, Wildman\[CloseCurlyQuote]s father,
Everett spoke up and said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I thought
you said they could ask the attorney
questions.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] Another village resident,
Bob Bayes concurred with this
statement.

Briney said the tax protestors
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]have other options .. . they say
things over and over.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] She also said

5 that \[OpenCurlyQuote]the board is not at fault and the

attorney is not at fault.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] She used the
term squabble to describe problems
stemming from tax bills.

Another resident, Chariotte
Newman, spoke up at this point and
said the disagreeinent was \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]not good
for (the possibility) of a development
at the lake, at Eagle Creek

Everett Wildman retorted at this
point, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Do you think they will want to
come here anyway with these high
taxes?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The board did what they had to do
. . . I paid high taxes, too,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Mrs.
Newman said. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Years and years ago
something should have been done
about it.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They have a citizens right to

know,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Everett Wildman said. To
which Mrs. Newman retorted, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It
was in the paper.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Village trustee Ron McClain said
that probably nobody. understood
what the impact would be of the
higher taxes. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It does seem like a
great increase, but everything is in
black and white. Anyone can come up
(to the office) and look at the records.
The money has been spent.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Everett Wildman stuck by his

original statement, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I think they
have a right to know.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
Briney replied by listing a number

of things she had heard like, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The
board is getting kickbacks (from the
purchase of the new police car). . .

you wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t believe the things I have
heard.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Another accusation she had
heard was that the board had \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]ab-
scounded with the park fund.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
Earlier in the meeting, the board
agreed to place the money in a
special interest bearing account
which is to be used only for a park or
a swimming pool.

McClain pointed out that the tax
protestors could have come to the
board last year when the tax levy was
