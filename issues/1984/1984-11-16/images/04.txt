\[OpenCurlyQuote]work on the book with a series
of newspaper articles, hoping to
gather feedback from individuals

who attended the small country

schools in the county of Shelby before
consolidation of the 1940\[CloseCurlyQuote]s.

velopes did not result with a 100
percent response, the 120 completed
forms returned provided more than
an adquate supply of memories of
school days gone by. Those stories
were included with short on

county.

meetings leaving the car unmarked.
Briney said she had agreed with that
stand until she read a newspaper
article that instructed children never
to go near a car which was unmarked
and the driver said he was a police
officer.

The motion to mark the car with
decals on the door and trunk was
unanimously approved. Carter
volunteered to do the work free. The
cost of the decals will be ap
proximately $79.

A second motion to install the bar
lights was turned down by a motion of
4-2. Voting against the motion were
Thurber, John Diss, Ron McClain and
Larry Rodman. Voting for the motion
were Carter and Dwight Riley.

Carter pointed out that new bar
lights were purchased at a cost of $275
just last year for the old police car.
He felt they were needed to make the
car more visible when Love was
going to a call.

CARTER ALSO questioned Love
about the shotgun holder that had
been in the old car and not in the new
car. Love said he and village em-
ployee Doug Ryherd had been
working on a problem with the
electrical switch that triggers the
holder and it would be fixed and in-
stalled very shortly.

Carter will assist with installing the
shotgun holder, and if there are any
more electrical problems, McClain
will also help.

In other police related action, the
board gave the nod to Love to attend
two weeks of Youth Officer Training
at the Police Training Institute at the
University of Illinois. The cost of the
course will be reimbursed by the
state. The full-time course is held in
December.

Love said the course covers a
variety of topics dealing with
juveniles, child abuse; family con-
flict, etc. He said that 90 percent of
his dealings are with \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]children and
problems communicating with

IN OTHER ACTION, water
commissioner Dwight Riley reviewed

repairing the old pump w

have been $6,115. The cost of the new
pump was $4,750, and the new sub-
mersible pump is guaranteed for ten

years

Approximately $2,000 raised at 1976
Bicentennial activities and placed in
a special park account will be
transferred to a village account so the
money can generate interest.

Evaun Lynch said the money has
been sitting in a checking account at
the Bank of Findlay for the last ten
years, and she needed to have some
other names put on the account.

A suggestion was made by Carter
that the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]money be spent where it

the natural gas fund were exceeding

receipts.

One bid of $500 from Bob Boar-
man\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Union 76 in Shelbyville for the
old police car as received and ac-
cepted by the board. The car needs to
have a battery installed as the old
battery was used on another piece of

equipment.

Carter told the board he thought the
trouble getting bids for the old car
was due to \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]stories in the paper.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
Newspaper accounts since March
quoted Carter\[CloseCurlyQuote]s and Thurber\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
reports of detailed problems with the
old car which lead the board to decide
in an \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]emergency situation\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] to allow
Carter and Love to buy a new vehicle.

AS ROAD COMMISSIONER,
Rodman asked for the board\[CloseCurlyQuote]s ap-
proval to have Herb Bricker Sr. to
take care of snow removal this
winter. Bricker had taken care of the
village for three years. Last year,
township crews in Okaw and Todd\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
Point were in charge of snow removal
in Findlay.

The board agreed that Bricker
should take care of snow removal

again.

No utility cut-off hearings were
held Monday night. One scheduled
hearing was called off when the
delinquent customer paid off the
account in the middle of the meeting.
Village attorney E.C. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Chris\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
Eberspacher III reported that he had
taken care of all delinquent
customers to date and that about $800
had been collected as a result.

Eberspacher also reported there
was no work from the arbitration
proceedings on the status of the
village\[CloseCurlyQuote]s case with sewer contracto:
Harshman Plumbing, Heating and
Electrical. However, he didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t see
any difficulties, but called it the
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]typical delay associated with ar-
bitration.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
