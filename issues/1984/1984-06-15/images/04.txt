With a list of songs as long as your
arm, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Tintypes\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] is a short course in
American music - with a little
history thrown in for good measure.
The musical production which
opened Tuesday at The Little Theatre
on the Square is two-and-a-half hours

tycoons were rich and getting richer,
