The actual amount the village will
levy will be less than ten percent of
the appropriations, Eberspacher
added.

Trustees, Eberspacher and two
respresentatives of Harshman
Plumbing, Heating and Electric met
in closed session to discuss possible
litigation, although no formal action
was taken.

The board will meet again at 7 p.m.
June 25 in the village hall.

The board, at a hearing im-
mediately prior to the meeting,

non-payment

was too long and asked the trustees to

ee eee
it.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Eberspacher said, however, that

legal constraints made the process

deductions, leading to termination as speedy as
possible

Trustees also passed the prevailing
wage act at Monday night\[CloseCurlyQuote]s meeting.

Eberspacher told the trustees that,
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]In my opinion you don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have to pay
it\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] because the state failed to provide
the money necessary to do so along
with the law.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The city is not liable until then,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]
said.

Eberspacher

He said the state either has to
provide the money or amend the
mandates act before the village is
affected by the law.

In other business, the board
decided to absorb an increase in gas
rates from Natural Gas Pipeline
instead of passing it along to
customers.

Thurber said he had rec *
assurances that the village
receive \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]all or most\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] of the rats
back \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]in the form of rebates.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

The reduced its
rates 6.2 percent, Thurber said, \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]and
now they\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve turned around and an-
nounced a 10.57 percent increase\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] on
an annualized basis.

The board also noted that the
possibility of shifting Findlay Days
from Labor Day weekend to the
weekend before could bring people to
the town two weekends instead of one.

Thurber said because of the high
amount of traffic coming through
town to use the lake, spreading the
activity over two weekends might
ease the congestion.

However, Mayor Briney noted that
the number of people attending the
Findlay Days celebration was
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]partly contingent on the holiday.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Summer reading program will
start in Findlay on June 20

program will
begin Wednesday, June 20 and
continue for six weeks. Library board
trustee Susan Vadakin is conducting

be held each Wednesday morning in
the library. The first session, for
children entering kindergarten, first
grade and second grade will take
place between 9 a.m. and 10:30 a.m.

and 12 noon.

Mrs. Vadakin explained that the
summer reading program will in-
clude crafts, games, activities,
stories, and a chance for the children
to brouse and check out library
books. Other plans for the program
include special activities to celebrate
Independence Day. The special

entering Heritage Day program will probably

be held on Tuesday, July 3.

On the last day of the program,
Mrs. Vadakin said that there will
probably be a picnic and reading
program participants will receive
certificates for their participation in
the program.
