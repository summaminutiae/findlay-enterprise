Warren Ferguson, Mick Ferguson
of Bethany and Jim Burkhead of
Oakley stopped in Findlay Tuesday
morning on their way to the
covered bridge near Cowden and
Williamsburg Hill. The carriage
drivers travel about 25 miles per
day, and they eat and sleep in their
wagons. They carry a stove, beds,
groceries and hay for their trip. The
group will return home Friday.

Who lived on the island of ham.

Now there is no more Jan.
