pense, and \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think we need it.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

In response, Mayor Pauline Briney
said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]in my opinion the police car
needs to be reliable.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Mrs. Briney,
although not voting on the issue,
leaned toward the purchase of a new
car

Just last month the board discussed
purchasing a second truck for use by
village employees. Currently, only
one truck is operable. At that time,
the proposal was tabled until repair

were up to
ticipated hearings to cut off gas,
water and sewer service did not
materialize. |

Some of the delinquent customers
paid their bills Monday afternoon to
avoid problems.

Riley said that he wanted to

offices in Carlinville and a local office
in Shelbyville.

He told the board members that
even if they agreed to the program,
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]there is no promise we're going to
get any.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Last year workers in a
similar program helped with painting
and

appraoched about safety on the
Findlay-Bethany blacktop. The board
voted last month to remove stop signs
placed on the road adjacent to the
grade school on the recommendation
of county highway superintendent,
Star Reynard.

As a result, there is still a safety
hazard for children crossing the
street on their way to and from
Findla |

Several alternatives were
discussed by the board including
hiring an additional crossing guard.
The board decided to approach the
school board about reinstituting a
program of using sixth graders as
crossing guards.

Such a program was in effect in
Findlay in the past, and older
children helped younger children
cross the dangerous street. In ad-
dition, as one board member pointed

out, the school children need to have
some crossing education.

One board member, Larry Rod-
man, expressed concern that there
was still another two months of
school, and any delay of action would
be a safety hazard.

THE BOARD VOTED TO donate
$200 to the Lake Shelbyville Boosters
that he and Mrs. Briney had attended
a meeting of the reactivated group at
which a proposal was discussed to
Rail ees

Such a brochure would be made
available at camping and boating
shows in St. Louis, Indianapolis and
Chicago. He said that no brochure
about the lake has been prepared for
several years.

Several other area municipalities
and area banks have been contacted
about providing funds to produce the
brochure. Thurber said that~ the
Sullivan City Council had voted to
donate $500 to the project.

The village\[CloseCurlyQuote]s donation will come
out of revenue sharing funds and will
not be paid out until later this sum-
mer.

THURBER REPORTED that
Natural Gas Pipeline has announced

verting the area into a park.
However, the majority of people
responding to the survey was against
the proposal citing the location,
problems with drainage and other
negative aspects of the plan. Riley
dropped the proposal and did not bid
on the property as a result of the
negative survey.
Mrs. Lucas said that \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]it was nice

The rest of the synopsis for \[OpenCurlyQuote]The
Butler Did It\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] goes like this: \[OpenCurlyQuote]The
hostess has arranged all sorts of
amusing incidents from the mystery
voice on the radio to the menancing
face at the window. The creepy old
mansion is full of strange secrets.
Why does the social secretary carry a
hatbox everywhere she goes? Who\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
the corpse in the wine cellar? How
about the astonishing female who
arrives via helicopter during a
howling storm?

\[OpenCurlyQuote]When an actual murder happens,
each guest realizes he or she could be
accused. The outraged hostess offers
a huge reward to the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]detective\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] who
brings in the killer. And what an
assortment of zany guests are at the
mansion. There is an inscrutable

New York couple, and an intellectual
type who idolizes Sherlock Holmes.

When they\[CloseCurlyQuote]re not busy tripping over --

the clues, they trip over each other.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
