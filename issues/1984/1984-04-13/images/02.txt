life. Can you imagine the fear of a
child who is made to watch.a small
animal butchered and told the same
will happen to them if they tell their
parents? Maybe the worst thing that
could possibly happen to them is let
the mete out the punishment.
I'll bet they\[CloseCurlyQuote]d have some good ideas

| of how to deal with the situation.

I'd like to see better relations bet-
ween the corps and the community.

sexually I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m sure we'd do our part to better the

relationship. I would.

Did you see the play, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Butler
Did It\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Friday night? I really enjoyed
it. I haven\[CloseCurlyQuote]t laughed so much in ages.
It really cracked me up. I attended

the dress rehearsal on Thursday
night. I didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t want to leave
home that \[OpenCurlyQuote]but I thought it

would be easier for me to get pictures
then than on the night of the play. So I
decided I'd run out and take a few
pictures and come home. I was en-
joying every minute of what I saw, so
I stayed until the last bows were
made and enjoyed every minute of it.
