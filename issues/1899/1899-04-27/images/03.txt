CHAPTER EXV,--Continven.

Foraging about, I founda bottle with
somé brandy left, for Hands; and for
myself I routed ont some biscuit, some
pickled fruits, a great bunch of raisins,
and @ piece of cheese, With these 1
eames on deck, put down my own stock
behind the rudder-head, and well ont of
the cockswain\[CloseCurlyQuote]s reach, went forward
to the water-breaker, and bad a good
deep drink of water, nnd then. and not

lili then, gave Hands the brandy,

He must have drunk & g'll before he

took the bottle from bis mouth.

Then f lashed the titer and went be-

the great bleeding stab he had received
in the thigh, anid after he hat catena
little and had a swatlow or two mort of
the brandy, he began to pick up visibly,
Bat straighter up, spoke louder and
clearer, and looked in every way an-

The breeze served as admirably. We
shinumed before it like a bird, the coast
Of the isiand @ashing br, and the view

with Wwarf pines, and soon we were bo-

by the great conquest I had made. I

both of pain and weakness--a hagward,
old man\[CloseCurlyQuote]s smile; but there was, besides
that, a grain of derision, a shadow of
trenehery, in his expression as he oralti-
ly watched, and watched, and watched
me at my work.

CHAPTER SAVE.

The wind, serving us toa desire, now
hnuled into the west. We could run so
much the easier from the northwest
eorner of the isiand to the mouth of the
North inlet. Only, as we had no power
