ext, until £found the tavern in qimation.
tt was a bright enough little place of
entertainment. The sign was newly
painted; the windows bad neat rod
vurtains; the floor was cleaaly sanded.
There was a street on either side. and,
an open door on both, whieh made the
lnege, lew room pretty clear to xee in,
in spite of clonds of tobacco amoke,

The customers were mostly seafar-
ing men; and thew talked co touts

to enter,

word or a slap on the shoulier for the
uiost favored of his guests.

Now, te tell you the trath, from the
