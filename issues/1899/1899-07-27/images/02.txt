Nibu-palusar. the father of Neboehnad-
nexeae (1 Coc. Wi rese in grandeur,
power aul extent of dominion tlt Haby~
Jon Was taken by Cyris (C5050. At
the time of tis lesson Nabenitius was
the king, We have learned kitely from
the stone tablets that he bad a son,
Kelshazzar, of whom nothing was
known before, He was the crown
prince, and inay well have been acting
us king during his faiher\[CloseCurlyQuote]s hbsence
from the city at this tinw, though he
is not ealied king on the tablets. Neither
do they say that be way the son (often
equivulent to grandson in Hebrew) of
Nebuchadnezear (5:11); but there is
nothing opposed to the view that Na-
bonidus, of another dynasty, orarried
the duughter of Nebuchadnezzar, and
thus Belstinzgar weukl be his grand-
son. Belsbussur was but a youth of 14
or iG Nears, rush, will and giddy with
his uneontrailed power, Seeure in his
ilefensce. he made a great feast to a
thousraid of the nobles. He thought
how he conld envich the splemlor of
his feast by the sicred goblets and
dishes of gold that Nebuchadnezzar had
taken from the temple at Jerusalem.
The wickainess of thls set consisted
(1) Th profaning these sacred utensils
to base uses. (2) Increasing the insult
hy doing it at a feast to an idol, thus

\[OpenCurlyQuote]implying that the idol wos superior to

the living God. (3) in deing it at an
immoral und drunken revel, thus insult-
ing the moral law of God.
