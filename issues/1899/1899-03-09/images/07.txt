Young and debonair;
Leave the city\[CloseCurlyQuote]s smoke and hurry,

Notay streets and nojsome alleys,
Love of gol and greed of gain,
Where the soul ts crthbed and cabined,
Where the heart had lack of roum,
Where the ghosts of want and h

PART I.
CHAPTER XTU--Cownscen.

The captuin was too bright to be in
the way. He whipped out of sight in a
moment, leaving Silver to arrange the
party; and I fancy it was as well he did
50. Had he been on deck, he could no
Jonger co much as have pretended not
to understand the situation. It was as
plain as day. Silver was the eaptain,
and a mighty rebellious crew he had of
it, The honest handse--and I was soon
to nee it proved that there were such
oa board--must have been very stupid
fellows, \[OpenCurlyQuote]Or, rather, I suppose the trath
was this: that all hands were dienffect-
ed by the example of the ringleaders--
B= oaly some more, some less; and n few,
ae. ae being good fellows in the main, eduld

Sea neither be led nor driven any further.
it is one thing to he idle and skutk, and
aquite another to tale a ship and mur-
der a number of innocent men.

At last, however, the party was made
Satie up. Six fellows were to stay on board,

7 and the remaining 13, including Silver,
began to embark.

Then it was that there came inte mr
head the first of the mad notions that
eontribnted so mich to save our lives.
af six men were left by Silver, it was.
plain our party could not take and fight
the ship; «and since only cix were left,
it was equally plain that the eahin par-
ty had no present need of my assist-
ance, Ft ceeprred to me at onee-to #6
ashore, fsa Effy Thad etipped over the
side, and curled up in the fore-sheets
of the neuresf boat, and almest at the
same mamens she shaved off.

The crews raced for the beach; but
the boat J was in, having seme start,
and being at once the lighter and the
better manned, shot far ahead of her
consort, and the bow hadstruck among |
the shore-side trees, and FE had exnglit ;

plunged into the nearest thicket, whi j
Silver and the rest were still 100 Yards |
behind.

¥ had crossed a ranrshy tract fall a?
Willows, bulrushes, and odd ontland-
ish, swampy trees, and I had now come
out pon the skirts of an open piece of
undulating. sandy eountry, about a
mile long, dotted with a few pines, and
& great number of contorted trees, not
unlike the oak im proweh, but pale iu
the follage, ke willows, Gnu the far
ile of the pew stood one of the hills,
with two quaint, craggy peaks, shining
vivklly in the sun.

1 now felt for the frst time the jor
of exploration. The isle was wninhab-
ited; my shipmates I bad left behind,
ani nothing lived in front of me bat
dumb brutes and fowls, I turned
hither and thither among the trees.
Here and there were flowering plants
unknown to me; here and there f saw
snakes, and one raised his head from
a ledge of x rock and hissed at me with
a noise not unlike the spinning of »
top. Little did Lsuppose that he was a
deniiv enemy, and that the noise was
the famous rattle.

Then I cathe to along thicket of these
oak-like trevs--live or evergreen oaks,
Theard afterward they shonkd be called
--which grew low nlong the sand like
bramides, the boughs curionsly twist-
mh, the foliage compact, lke thatch,
The thicket stretched down from the
top one of the sandy knolls, spreading
and growing taller os it wert, \[OpenCurlyQuote]until it
reached the margin of the broud, sedy
fen. throngh which the nenrest of the
Hittle rivers soaked its way into the an-
chorage. The marsh was steaming in
the stroug sun, and the outline of the
Spy-glass trembled through the haze.

All at once there began to zu a sort of
hustle among the bulrushes; a wild
duck flew up with s quack, another fol-
lowed, and sepn over the whole surface
of the marsh a greut cloud of birds
hr .. sereaming and circling in the
a. T Judged at ouce that some of ny
shipmates must be drawing near along
the borders of the fen. Nor was I de-
ceived; for soon I heard the vers dis-
fant and low tones of a human voice,
which a3 I continued to give ear, grew
stentdily louder and nearer.

This put me in great fear, and I
¢rawlel under cover of the nearest live-
oak and squatted there, hearkening, as
silent as 2 mouse,

Another voice answered: and then
the first voice, which i now recognized
to be Silver's, once more took wp the
story, ani ran on for a long while in 2
atream, ouly nosy and again interrupt-
ed by the other. Ry the sound they
must have been talking enrnestly, and
almost flercely; bat no distines word
came to my hraring,

At last the speakers seemed to have
paused, and perhaps to have gat down:
for uot only did they cease to draw yny
neater, hut the birds themselves began
te grow more quict, sii} to seiile apuin
to their places In the swamp.

And sow 1 begin to feel that 1 was
neglecting my business; that sinve 1
had bren so foolhardy as tocomeashore
with these desperadaes, the Jeast |
could do was t% overhear them at their
councie; and my plain ard obvious
duty was to draw as Wlose as FE could
mnanuge, under the favorable umbuss
of the crouching trees.
