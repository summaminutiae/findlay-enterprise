CHAPTERE 1i.--Coxtincen,.

Obriously he had not the faintest
eonception of what the nrony was all
about, nor had his ancie\[CloseCurlyQuote]s will any-
thing whaterer to do with iis consid-
erations. \[OpenCurlyQuote]Fhey were carried on wpon
Hines of pure and unadulterated in-
stinet--just as a young duck pokes its
flat bill about in a stupid ecarch for
the delicions mud which it has never
ween nor heal of, except in the awert
habbie of some soft mursery clucking

ever its pipped ege.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I wonder low the thing should be
brought about,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Stanten wottered, as
he lay on the sofa in the library, smok-
ing and dreaming.

Even then the innocently stupid fel-
low did not dream that he was doing

not have dane it. Ia fact, hy never
even fully realized how the thing was
@one, it was so quickly and easily ac-
complished when once he turned his
attention that way. But that was im-
material. ft was surely doe. te un-
questionably became engaged, and It
won a great relied to him to know and
fe have others Kaow that so much prog-
ress at least had been made towntds
the relief from society whieh he sought.

The reaily strange thing about it
was that it wosa lorermatch. At least
the Lombards all sai so, and evert one
admitted that they were the last peo-
ple in the world to be influenced be
any man\[CloseCurlyQuote]s millions--which proved to
be the casv, a Httle later,

The: immediate elects of the engaze-
ment were not in precise tine with the
final results he sovirht, tut Le reasoned
with himself; \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Lsuppose it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s 2 fellow's
duty to the lady he's to marry to go
with her into society, just as it's his
daty to stay with her at home after
they're married ;\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] so the poor, deluded
fellow honestiy, earnestly and patient-
iy plunged into a grand whirl of so-
eial life at Miss Lombard\[CloseCurlyQuote]s side, only
longing to have the transition state
over with, that he might arrive at the
stage where he could bo ict alone,

Stanton had hardly adjusted himself
to this when another disagreeable fea-
ture presented itself, Young Lombard,
bis future brother-in-law, was a iient
ef his whom he. had abvays consid-
ered an ideal business man; but it suud-
denly appeared that he was also an
ideal society man. 1t was simply a
sie of hira with which Stanten had
never chanced to seme in contact. Me
insisted upou putting him up et iwo
fashionable clubs.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I'm already = member of the pro-
fessional club over in the city,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he
sakk. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]fhat has some point toit. But
what's the sense of 2 social clu?"

lows snd kill an hour or tweofaneren-
lng new and then,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Lombert ured.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Bit I Laven't time oneurh as it is,

Stull, he clowcd hiosclf to he put up.

The thing which he abhorred inmost
intensely and reecived most abundant-
ty was flattery, Nest to that he dis-
liked being questioned. We is offen the
eoao With am expert iat cross-examina-
tions.

One evening at the clob Stanton wis
fortunate enough te meet w man Kho
Was not a bore. His name was Richard
faymond, He was enenyed in the in-
futaliee business im the far west, and
inew the country, even to the Pacitic
coast, with all the wonders and trens-
ares of its ticinage, as well as Stanion
immew Sew York or Mrookicw. He gave
him more entertaining and vatnable ip-
formation in fixe minutes thun he had
often obtained a¢ the club in am en-
tire evening,

He knev Stanton, too, and said some
very clever things about him, but he
sak them im such a clever way that
they were not ut all offensive, He
didn't stop the moment he had said
them and bow anil smirk and wait ow
a brood grin till Stanton had gurccedead
in saying something equally sity im
eontradiction or reed tion,

Stanton smiled as he sat contentedly
listening, and commented with him-
self: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]If he were te digress to insur-
ance, HOW, and tisk oom to fake owt m
policy In one of his companies, | pre-
sume I shonid do it.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Bypt Mr. Kay-
toon did not digress. He hardly men-
tioned Insurance again. Spenking of
minerals, however, be said that he had
brought on @ fine collection; it was nt
the hotel, and if Stanton enred to walk
home that way and stop for a moments
he shoul be gind to show it.

The colleetion proved thoroughiy en-
tertaining, and when, in the course of
conversation upon it, the subject of
Culitornin wines was touched, it ap
peared that Baymond had brought on
some <hoiee damples of these, too, in
proof of a pet theory hat with proper
care in preparation, «ml proper age,
the vineyards of the Pacitic esuld be
made to rival the vintage of the world.

While he was speaking of it he poured
aut 2 ginss of the wine. This was a
litle different; for among other social
habits which Stanton had never eon-
tracted was the hubit of drinking.

it oreurred to hing that there was same-

much other entertainment, amd he
drank the wine, niuvh as he would hace
