King Hoxsan, well beloved, was wont te

And in that faith he stept; and Bo pre

Tong live this proverb! While the world
shal rolt
To-mortows fresh vhal rise from out
the night,
AnA new-bantiize the indomitable soul
WIth courage for its mever-emling fight.

No one, T gay, is conquer\[CloseCurlyQuote]d Ull he yields;
And yield he neo not while, like mist
from glass,
God wipca the etain of Nfe\[CloseCurlyQuote]s old battie-
fields
From every morning that Ife brings to
pass.

Now day, new bi A Cots ,
