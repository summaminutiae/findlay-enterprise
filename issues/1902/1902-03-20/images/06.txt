Of "ne Bouti¢ute of Gocin\[CloseCurlyQuote] Eoamomica, Rew Waris,

iv IS-A KNOWLEDGE OF PRINCIPLES, NOT A

f COLLECTION OF FACTS, THAT SCHOOL EDU-
ee CATION SHOULD EURNISH. The time aud ability
f both of student and teacher are limited. It is, therefore,
\[OpenCurlyQuote]2 question of selecting subjects the study of which will best develop
ithe mental powers of the student,

If there are two subjects of equal merit as regards mental train-
ling, and one of them leads directly to the live interests with which
the student will have to deal as a citizen, and on which his personal
i welfare and the welfare of the community depends, and the other

+ go

Heals only te the stidy of a dead language and the details off some
L effete civilization having only the remotest relation to the. live affairs
bof to-day, there ought to be no diffienkhy in deciding which subject

That subject which eals to a knowledge of the affairs of modern
i dife has a double claim, for besides affording an opportunity for men-
tal training it furnishes preparations for ascful citizenship. In this:
respect economics is preeminent. because, besides affording as high
degree of mental training as these, it gives life to study, and social
equipment to the student.

ECONOMICS IS PREEMINENTEY A LOGICAL SUB-
JECT. It has to do with principles and deductions. It constantly
calls the reasoning faculties into action, and it is preeminently the
study that inspires observation. A study of the principle of wages
oF prices or rent or banking supplies its own incentive for observing
these phenomena. It is equally important and more effective as a
mental training than the study of history even; aud far be it from me
to belittle the study of history.

But, in comparing the claims for mental training of history and
economics, the superiority of cconomics is obyieus. Even if we avoid
the method of teaching history which takes note chiefly of battles,
royal coronitions, and court fends, and direct the studies entirely to
the important industrial, social and political events arising out of
the progressive struggles of the people for improvement, it still re-
mains chiefly a matter of memorizing. Jt is, indeed, of some conse-
quence that the student knows about the Norman Conquest, the
Magna Charta, the Statute of Laborers, the Bill of Rights, the Dec-
faration of Independence, the surrender of Cornwallis, and the Civil
War: BUT IT IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAT THE
MASSES KNOW WHAT DETERMINES THEIR WAGES,
HOW IMPROVEMENTS IN INDUSTRIAL CONDITIONS
ARE BROUGHT ABOUT, AND WHAT EFFECT CAPITAL
HAS UPON THE INDUSTRIAL WELFARE OF THE COM-
MUNITY. 3

if they know something of the fundamental principles that gov-
ern their industrial and social welfare, ther will have an intelligent
appreciation of the significance of these historic events. But if they
are ignorant of economic principles, these historic events, so many
facts memorized, are of little educational significance.

Clearty, in furnishing mental training for the vouth of the na-
tion, and especially the youth that has but a limited share of educa-
tional opportunity, training shonld be given in the subjects which lead
most directly to am acquaintance with the affairs of real life, thus at
once affording the dguble purpose of mental trai ing and preparation
for social uscluiness, ig
