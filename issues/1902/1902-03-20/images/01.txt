Prices the Lowest

at all tines. While we are not selling flour
as cheap as heretofore, the public must bear
in mind the fact that the price of flour has
risen, and consequently we are compelled to
raise the price slightly to be able to realize
any profit (rom its sale. We do aot believe

in selling one article at a joss and making up
the deficieacy on something clse, so the price
of flour is as follows: Glinvax, $1.20
Best XXXX, 61.10; Prairie, 61. Also
good dried peaches at 10 cents per pound,
and three cots of Horseshoe or Star Pobaces
tor 2c. Everything else
Give us atrial order. 8
