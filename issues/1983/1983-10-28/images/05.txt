THE FINDLAY ENTERPRISE--FINDLAY, ILLINOIS 62534 Page 5

Findlians appalled
with Lebanon tragedy

morning it's America\[CloseCurlyQuote]s fight: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We should have let

Israel clean up the P.L.O. Instead of

a peacekeeping force we should
have left it up to the Isralis. They un-
derstand and know how to deal with those

place, but it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s too late now to leave.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Tt is costing too many lives,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Joan
Herron said. However, she also added,
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s worth it if we reach a peace

agreement.

Greg Bohlen had some definite
opinoins. \[OpenCurlyQuote]We should be there en masse
or out completely. What happened in
Beruit is a crime. It typifies the actions
of Islamic religions and their values of
life. I think also that if intelligence
confirms, as top leaders indicate, that
the action was initiated by Iran.
Retaliation should be swift because once
someone gets away with something (like
aircraft ), it encourages other

to take the same type of action if

we don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t put a stop to it.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]T don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know why they are there for
sure,\[CloseCurlyQuote] John Love said of the Marines
presense, \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]but if they are to be left there
they should be able to use any means to

themselves.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
