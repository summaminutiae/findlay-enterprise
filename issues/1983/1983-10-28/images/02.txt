Me TRINKS 1 raice vin

i was astounded and crushed when I
heard of the needless deaths of Marines
in Lebanon.

So they were supposedly peacemakers.
Now they are the only ones at peace. I
abhor the thought that our nation could
send husbands, sons and fathers out to
die in a murderous attack under the
guise of peace making.

Call it what you will. I call it war, and
the Marines were in a no-win situation.
The natives of that country seem to have
been at war for some reason or other
since time began and probably always
will be. So why should we sacrifice the
young men of our country to their cause?

something
to the effect that \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]you can have it all.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
Well, the Marines in Bierut on that

untangle
difficulties there would be less blood shed
and more negotiating and com-
promising. I guess it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s easier for them to
let others shed the pools of blood on
foreign soil. I believe in peace, but at
what expense? Now, I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m wondering in
this case, what is the definition of peace?

early as they used to. They've waited for
the night designated for them, and we all
appreciate that.

Okay kids, Saturday night is your night

to howl, and as long as it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s all fun .

everyone will be happy. Today\[CloseCurlyQuote]s youth
seem to be more mature than the ones
who, a few years back, destroyed
property and wrote filthy words
everywhere they could find space. Some
villages have had a curfew in effect for a
couple of weeks to prevent premature
Halloweening. We haven\[CloseCurlyQuote]t needed a
curfew. The kids have been just great,
and we appreciate it.

In the very near future the equipment
at the old village hall will be moved to its
new location, just west of. the old
building, and the Community Center can
take over the building. Have you decided
what you can donate to make their
venture a success? I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve heard it called a
senior citizens center. Well, it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s that, but
it is also planned as a meeting place for
all who wish to use it. The young, middle
aged and elderly should benefit from its
existence. Help them to make it a reality
as soon as possible. We all need to be
involved, not just the few that started
plans for it. They\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve already contibuted a
lot of time and effort.

Letter To The Editor __

Writer upset

with prankster

To The Halloween Prankster:
I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve never had any reason to write a

I returned home at 8:30 p.m. Monday
night, and as I pulled onto the drive,
there was Robbie\[CloseCurlyQuote]s pumpkin, smashed
all over the driveway. Robbie was
Standing at the door, crying, wanting to
know why and who had done this to his
pumpkin.
Some of you reading this may laugh,
wondering if all I have to do is write

about a pumpkin. The thing to remember
is, what doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t seem important to us is
totally different to a 3% year old. This
was the first year Robbie got to carve his
own pumpkin, and it meant a lot to him.

So whoever did this, I hope you read
this and feel good, because you destroyed
a little boy\[CloseCurlyQuote]s dreams about the fun of
Halloween. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s not the money value that
bothers me; it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s the special value Robbie
got, doing it himself.

I remember having fun at Halloween,
but I never destroyed stuff. When will
you learn you can have fun without
tearing up stuff. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s to bad you had
nothing better to do.
