Can you pick the CIPS
meter reader?

If you picked the young man at top left or the
young lady at bottom right, you\[CloseCurlyQuote]re correct. As a
matter of fact, all four of these people are CIPS
meter readers.

Like many of our employees who call on
customers, our meter readers carry an official
CIPS identification card with their name and
picture.

If you\[CloseCurlyQuote]re in doubt about the identity of your
meter reader, or any other CIPS representative
who may call on you, ask to see that card.

if you\[CloseCurlyQuote]re still in doubt, call your CIPS office for
further verification.

We'd like to suggest that you always check the
identity of strangers before you allow them into
your home. If he or she is a CIPS employee, you'll
gladly be shown an official identity card . ..
our meter readers never leave the office without it.
