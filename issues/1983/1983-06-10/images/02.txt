Junior Stewman said that the closing of
Eagle Creek State Park definitely has
made a difference in his business. He is
the owner of J.R.\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Place, the downtown
restaurant, and said his business on
Saturday and Sunday morning was about

ference, but rainy weekend mornings
have been the times his sales were best.

I was invited to go for a boat ride
Saturday, but I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m staying off that lake
until the water level is lower and there\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
less debris in it. It looks dangerous to me.
I was told Monday morning that it may
not get down to normal pool this summer.
Well, if that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s true, I'll just skip any
boating this year.

I hope Eagle Creek will indeed be open
by July 1. On holiday weekends there are
always so many campers that some have
to be sent to overflow areas. And that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
when all parks are open. I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think
there are enough overflow areas to take
care of those who are denied access to

Eagle Creek.

Congratulations to Dudley Wright of
Shelbyville who celebrated his 100th
birthday Sunday.

Dogs running loose continue to be a
problem, so we'll probably have to resort
to stronger measures to make believers
out of dog owners.

The Bank of Findlay now has a
promotion going. Instead of guns in lieu
of interest they have trips to far away
places in lieu of interest.

You won't believe this, but I want to

to help us get the factory we've been
talking about, and I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m sure he\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll do it.

I know a secret about Rep. Mike Tate
-- he blushes real good, and he did just
that Monday morning when Woodrow

Enoch invited him to bring his wife and the

son down for a plane ride over Lake
Shelbyville. The problem is he has no
wife and no son. I guess Woody had him
mixed up with someone else.

I was unable to attend the economic
seminar hosted by Mike Tate in Decatur
Saturday, but from what I hear it could
be very helpful to small towns and small

Greg Bohlen says I can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t yet divulge
the name of the company who might put
a factory here. Well there\[CloseCurlyQuote]s no danger, I
forgot the name. Maybe it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s just as well.
This way I won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t let it slip. According to
Greg the plans for the factory are on
their way by United Parcel, and in a
week or two the men he\[CloseCurlyQuote]s been talking to
will be in Findlay for to meet.
I have great hopes of that factory
becoming a reality, and I hope not one
person in this community will be against
it. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m sure most fellow villagers are as
thrilled about the prospects as I am, and
I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m THRILLED! Greg hopes to hold a
press conference sometime in the next
two weeks.
