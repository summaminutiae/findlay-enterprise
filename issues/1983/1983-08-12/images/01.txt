the property
available for the board\[CloseCurlyQuote]s inspection.
Eberspacher told the board that all of the
expenses (legal and contractor fees
included) of tearing down the six
buildings would come to under $15,000.
Carter moved to authorize Eber-
spacher to proceed with the demolition.
Voting for the motion were Carter, Dave
Thurber and Ron McClain. Those Op-

posed were Dwight Riley and
Dwight Larry

That item of business, and several
problems related to the new sewer plant
were taken care of before the board
appointed a new trustee. Trustee Chuck
Farris resigned last month.

Mayor Briney skirted the issue, and as
a result, the public will never know
exactly who was in favor of i
new trustee John Diss. Under state
Statutes, Mrs. Briney is to make the
actual appointment.

She declined to do so, and as a result,
three individuals were nominated by
three board members. Riley nominated
John Cleveland, Rodman nominated
Dave Brooks and Thurber nominated
Diss

Two secret ballots were taken before
Diss took his seat. On the first ballot,
Diss received two votes, Brooks two

employees Doug
Ryherd and Tim Spellman. The board
agreed to pay the two men for extra (Y)
time -- 51% hours for Ryherd and 19%
hours for Spellman.

A suggestion to hire a part-time em-
ployee for the weekend was made by
Rodman, but no action was taken.
Payment for the Y time, the board
generally agreed, would continue.

Policeman John Love got a boost in
uniform pay from $70 per annum to $100.
In a move with which Mayor Briney
disagreed, the board voted to give
Ryherd and Spellman $100 each to
purchase uniforms.

Briney felt that the additional expense
was not justified.

The board also purchased two pagers
for village employees at $700. There will
be an additional charge of $18 per month
to use the pagers..The pagers were
purchased from Revenue Sharing Funds.
The monthly service fee will come out of
the general fund.
