Very often I read something really
amusing that someone else has written
and wonder, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Why didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t I think of
that?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] In the last issue of the Shelby
County News Gazette Kathy Hurst wrote,
Dan Crane\[CloseCurlyQuote]s romp with a
17 year old page is not all that
He was merely doing to the page what
Congressmen have been doing to the tax
payers for many years.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I liked that and

The kick off pork supper to benefit the
proposed community center was a
whopping success. The people who
worked the supper and came out in the
heat to enjoy it deserve a medal. I think I
was the hottest I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve ever been in my life.

I read an article on road improvements
and was thrilled to see that one of the

proposed improvements

and resurface three miles of road from
Route 128 to Dazey Street in Findlay. I
was a little disappointed to find out that
the job is scheduled to be done between
1965 and 1988. Of course my opinion is
that it should be a top priority and be
done sooner. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve worried about that road
for years, especially since so many two
unit vehicles use it everyday. I hate
driving on it because it seems so narrow.
Here\[CloseCurlyQuote]s hoping we don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have any ac-
cidents on it before they make it safer in
two or three more years.

I like my job and am always ready to
pick up a bit of news, take some pictures
or whatever I might do to make the
Enterprise a better paper. But I decided
| vacation time was not particularly good
for me. I didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t want to go back to work. I
just wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t ready yet. Probably
everybody feels the same way. I couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
stand not being busy for very long, but I

I made a statement in last week\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
Enterprise that wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t true. The first.
time I watched a ball game at Riverton I
somehow got the idea that all of the
ballparks were lighted. Now I know that
at least one isn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t. I watched another ball

there Friday morning, and that
it ous tat fheod Nevertheless, I'd
like to see the Findlay ball diamond
lighted so more people could get more
use of it.

Barry Martin gave me a really neat
recorder. Now I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m attempting to learn to
use it. Last Thursday the telephone rang,
and I laid the gadget down to answer the
phone. During the entire conversation I
heard what I thought was a siren. I told
Connie I wanted to see why the siren was
blowing and that I would call her back. I
immediately called the Village Hall to
see what was going on and Joan said she
couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t hear anything but she\[CloseCurlyQuote]d go
outside and see if she could hear it there.
Dumb me! While she was outside |
discovered that the siren was on the

open
and I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m sure a lot of others do also. I hate
losing even one business in town. We
simply can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t afford to.
I've heard about some plans to open
another business, and I sure hope it
happens.

All too often I hear someone say, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]This
town is dying.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Well maybe, but I cer-
tainly haven\[CloseCurlyQuote]t given up hopes for it yet.
Not by a long shot. I think we'll make it.

Sees

Bernice Manley of Findlay, 71, shot a
hole-in-one on the number 2 hole par 3 at
Timberlake Golf Course two weeks ago
on Friday with a number 7 iron. The
event was witnessed by Mush Shirey of
Sullivan and another golfer. She said she
was almost as thrilled that she shot a 39
for the 9 holes, her best score ever.

Mrs. Manley said she started golfing in
1968 and one of the reasons they moved to
Findlay was to be near the Timberlake
course

She and her husband Bernole belong to
a couples league that plays at Tim-
berlake on Thursday evenings.
