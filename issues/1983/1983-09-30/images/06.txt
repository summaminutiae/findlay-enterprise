Electric charges to decrease

Basic energy charges for residential
electric customers of. Central Illinois
Public Service Co. will decrease nearly
29 percent when the utility\[CloseCurlyQuote]s winter rate
becomes effective Oct. 1.

Residential customers will be chargéd
9.89 cents per kilowatthour of electricity
during the months October through May,
a reduction of nearly two cents. They
have paid a base rate of 7.83 cents per
kilowatthour for the last four months.

The higher summertime rate reflects
the utility\[CloseCurlyQuote]s incteased costs of generating
electricity during the four-month period
June through September, according to
J.G. Bachman, manager of Rates and
Research.

Bachman said the reduction beginning
Oct. 1 reflects customers\[CloseCurlyQuote] lower demand
for electricity during the eight non-

summer months.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We're a summer peaking utility,
which means the highest electric
demand placed on our system by
customers occurs during the summer
months,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Bachman explained. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]As a
result of this increased demand it costs
us more to provide electricity.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]However, the use of our generating
capacity and other facilities decreases in
other months, leading to a lower charg
for electric service.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] :

Customers\[CloseCurlyQuote] bills still will include a
customer service charge, an electric fuel
adjustment charge and state and any
locally imposed utility taxes.

CIPS provides electric service to
nearly 307,000 customers in 551 com-
munities of central and southern Ilinois.
