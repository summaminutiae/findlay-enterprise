Findlay farmer Arnold \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Cap\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Uphoff
remains in the intensive care unit at
Decatur Memorial Hospital with injuries
he suffered when the combine he was
driving was struck by a Mopac train
Tuesday evening.

Uphoff suffered broken ribs,
lacerations and a possible skull fracture
as a result of the accident which took
place at approximately 6:30 p.m.

Findlay Fire Protection District
personnel, emergency medical
technicians and firemen, worked for
almost an hour to remove Uphoff from
the John Deere combine. They were
assisted by the Shelby County Rescue
Squad.

Uphoff was taken by Findlay am-
bulaace to Shelby Memorial Hospital and
transferred later to Decatur Memorial
Hospital. He has undergone several tests
in the past two days as a result of his

injuries.

The accident occured on a rural Mopac
crossing on a township road one mile
south of Findlay. Uphoff was heading

east at the time of the wreck, following
another combine driven by his nephew,
Doug Uphoff. |

Doug Uphoff crossed the tracks first
and tried to notify his uncle about the
approaching train by C.B. radio. The
train was unable to stop in time to avoid
the collision and the combine was pushed
three-quarters of a mile before it was
halted

It took nearly two hours for the com-
bine to be freed form the tracks. The
combine was a total loss and there was
an estimated $4,000 damage done to the
Mopac train engine.
