County Clerk Dwight Campbell this

week said that he has not \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]failed\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] to do
anything in respect to the Village of
Findlay\[CloseCurlyQuote]s tax levy, and also maintains,
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Tt is not our fault if the Village failed to
provide levies for additional purposes.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

In a letter to Enterprise editor Cherise
Cruit, Campbell outlines tax levy
procedures that were followed by the
village since 1979, complete with copies
of the ordinances.

He notes that prior to 1980 the village
made a levy for only the general fund and
the library fund. Then in 1980 levies were
made for general corporate, library,
police protection, auditing, chlorination
of sewage, school crossing guard,
retirement, tort insurance, unem-
ployment insurance, and workmens
compensation taxes. The total revenue
from all these levies came to $27,241.

In 1981, Campbell says, the levy was
prepared in a different format by a
different village attorney. Although the
ordinance shows various sub-totals
within the Corporate fund levy of $42,100,
there are no specifications as to which, if
any, of the sub-totals are to be levied

separately for each purpose allowed by
law. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Pulling out a sub-total would cause

the total corporate general fund levy to
be incorrect. Also, we are by law, not
permitted to pick out items for the ap-
propriations to extend as being levied,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
he says.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]In addition to the appropriation
documentation, you must also specify the
purpose and amount of each levy
authorized by the statutes.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Also, there was no truth in taxation
certification filed by the village so we
are, by law, limited to extend no more
than 105 percent of the previous year\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
extension. In the end, the village
received a total of $14,492.24 compared to
the requested $45,950 as a result of the
ordinance format which did not specify
any levies in addition to the General
Levy.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

The 1982 levy was pretty much a
of the situation of the year
Campbell indicates.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The original (1983) village ordinance
was prepared in the same format as the
previous two years with the total cor-
porate levy being $37,500 and the library
levy being $4,000, or a total of $41,900.
However, prior to the deadline for filing
the levy, it was discovered that the

A meeting was held Saturday morning to determine the status of construction at
the Findlay sewage treatment plant. The plant was originally scheduled for
completion last year. The village board set Friday, Sept. 30 as the deadline for
construction to be completed. Scheduled to attend the meeting were members
of the village board, village employees, representatives of Harshman Plumbing,
Heating and Electrical of Sullivan and representatives of Upchurch, Davidson

and Assoc. of Mattoon.

village tax levy

levies, as they were being filed, were not
producing the tax money desired,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
Campbell says.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The present village attorney, E.C.

Eberspacher, advised me that we should
be extending other levies as allowed by
law. This would have meant that we
would be pulling certain figures out of the
appropriations column to use as levies.
We advised that we are not permitted to
do this; and that certainly it was too late
to change the extensions of previous
years\[CloseCurlyQuote] levies. We did, however, agree to
accepting an amended levy ordinance to
be used to extend taxes for the year 1983,
collectible in 1984. The amended levy was
ed in this office on Sept. 13, showing a
down of the various levies to be
nded totaling $46,035.
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We will be extending the 1983 taxes to
be collected in 1984 based on these
figures in the amended levy ordinance.
The legal rate limits and the Truth in
Taxation limits will still be applied as
provided by law, which could limit the
amount to be extended in each levy.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

The amended ordinance passed on

purposes in the following amounts:

The levy for playground and recreation
has raised some eyebrows

since such a levy can be made only
following a referendum allowing the
levy. Such village records as are readily
available do not indicate that and such
referendum was ever held.

The working cash fund levy is also
new. This is a special levy that has a time
limit for application. Revenues can be
transferred to the general fund.

The village also shares in the town-
ships\[CloseCurlyQuote] levies for road and bridge pur-
poses.
