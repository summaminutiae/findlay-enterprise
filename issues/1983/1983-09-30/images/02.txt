--

Saturday was the first time I ever
attended a college football game. I guess
I never really wanted to before, but since
[ have a grandson playing on the
Wesleyan University team I'll probably
try to attend a lot of games at a lot of
different places. I really enjoyed it. Of
course I hardly know what they\[CloseCurlyQuote]re doing,
so lately I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve been watching some games
on T.V. that I really didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t even care
about -- just trying hard to learn a little
about the game. Everybody in my family
knows about football but me. Probably
they\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll be wishing I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d stay home so I
won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be continually saying, \[OpenCurlyQuote]What are
they doing now?, or what did they do?, or
what are they going to do? I may never
know all there is to the game, but this
proud grandma enjoys watching him
play anyway.

I have a bone to pick with Mike Tate.
He told me the team\[CloseCurlyQuote]s name was \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The
Green Wienies\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] -- not true -- they\[CloseCurlyQuote]re
called the Titans. They\[CloseCurlyQuote]re only called
green Weenies by the Millikin team, and
that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s where Mike played. Maybe some
day I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll quit believing everything I hear.
Okay Mike -- for that I owe you one.

Another kicker, while practicing,
kicked a ball into the bleachers. Wayne
caught it and passed to Brett on the field.
That\[CloseCurlyQuote]s the first Brett know we were
there, and I heard him say, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]That\[CloseCurlyQuote]s my
dad\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. I suppose he thought his dad
couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t throw a good pass. |

The last time I was in a college football
stadium was in 1943. That was at Duke
University in Durham, N.C., and they
were playing Georgia Tech that day. I
didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t care anything about football so I
didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t stay for the game. Instead I toured
the campus. And all I remember about it
now is that I had never seen so much ivy
in my life. :

Be sure to obey the speed limit and
school zone signs. You might save a
child\[CloseCurlyQuote]s life, and besides that you might
get a ticket. We just can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have drivers
speeding through school crossing zones
or even around town. Just remember
that every crossing in town is a school
crossing for some child.

__ The safety of the children going to and

from school is the responsibility of all of
us. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a special responsibility of the
parents to train their children to watch
for the traffic and to cross at the school
crossing where we have a guard if they
have to cross Division St.

You wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t believe how many kids
cross at other crossings. If they\[CloseCurlyQuote]re going
to the grade school, parents should insist
they cross at the safest place, and that

has to be where Dorothy Brooks stands
three times a day to protect them.

There are other dangerous crossings
also. Probably close to a hundred people
have signed a petition to that effect.
When this came up I wondered what ever
happened to the safety patrol? I thought
that was a good idea and still think so. It
teaches the patrol boys or girls
responsibility and also protects the
Students. Another idea would be for all
the people who signed the petition, or any
others who might like to volunteer, to
take turns watching the most dangerous
crossings. Probably if everyone took his
turn, he would only have to do that little
chore about once in three months. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d be
happy to take my turn.

Sunday was my birthday, and my
horoscope was telling me how to deal
with a romantic partner. Boy, that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a
tough one. I guess that one must have
been meant for somebody else that has
the same birthday as mine.

There\[CloseCurlyQuote]s been a big problem with
speeders on the road north of town. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve
heard a lot of complaints about it, and
I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve also heard how the problem is going
to be dealt with. So -- if you want to keep
your money in your pocket and avoid
some extra writing on your driver\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
license you\[CloseCurlyQuote]d better slow down.
