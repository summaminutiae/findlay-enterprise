Village employees Betty Perry and Tim Spellman were working hard last week
remodeling the old firestation and getting the building ready for use as the new
village hall. Following the remodeling, village offices will be moved into the other
building. The old village hall will become the Findlay Community Center.

drain water into a ditch on the south side
of the school.

should be able to put water into the old
sewer system, but it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s plugged up and
