My Real Christmas Tree

One Christmas when I was a baby we

"Teetusociercahaee
e got and we could it

through the door. -

It was real big and real tall and when
we got it all decorated it was beautiful.

Mom and Dad had to put the tree in the
playpen so Jennifer and I wouldn't pull it
over on top of us.

When we took it down and started out
the door all the long needles flew
everywhere.
