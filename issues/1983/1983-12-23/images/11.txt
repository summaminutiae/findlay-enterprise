Nellie Newsbom was the first witness
for the defense, and she testified that.she
did not know who owned the clothes
which she found in the washer in the
basement and also denied seeing the

Saddoris) testified that her son arrived
at her house about 1 a.m. Dec. 4, and she
didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know what he was wearing. She

also testified that he was not capable of

murder. It was not unusual for her son to
clean his truck at least once a week, and
he did so after he arose late the following
morning :

Mean chose to take the stand in his own
defense. He testified to his activities
between Dec. 3 and Dec. 6, including the
fact that he had asked Kane for a date
that Friday afternoon, and she turned
him down saying she already had a date
with someone else that night.

An employee of Tate\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Garage, he
testified tht he went home after work and
changed from his dirty T-shirt and jeans
and put them in the hamper before
taking a nap. After waking at 10 p.m. he
went to the Red Barn.

When questioned about cleaning his
truck the next day, he testified that he
always tried to keep his truck shining
and cleaned it because he had recently
been deer hunting. He stayed in his
apartment Saturday night and Sunday,
only going out Sunday morning, he said.

The first he knew of the murder, he
said, was when police questioned him on

for the defendant. It was dark,

the man\[CloseCurlyQuote]s face.

Wagner opened her closing arguments
on Friday morning by pointing out to the
jury that Mean had been at the old folk\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
home to ask Kane for a date. He felt
angry and rejected so he left and waited
at the complex for Kane to get home.
When he approached her to break her

She said he used the towels to clean up
the blood, changed his clothes and went
to the laundry room to wash them along
with the towels. He then removed the
body in the trunk of the car and went to
the bar to create an alibi.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Instead of cleaning the blood of a deer
from the trunk, he cleaned the blood of a
dear, alright, a dear. old girl friend.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
Witnesses said the truck was coming and
going all the time Mean said he was
sleeping.

In closing she said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]He murdered --

Candy Kane. She lost four or five pints of
blood. She\[CloseCurlyQuote]s dead out there somewhere.
Just remember, this was a murder, and
Mike Mean did it.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Lucas, in his summation, said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]If you
judge this man guilty you'll be sending
an innocent man away for years. The
truck was heard going in and out but
never seen. Since Mean had never been
in the apartment he would not have
known where to find the hammer.

He told the jury that Mean answered
questions easily and without hesitation
while on the stand, \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]Is that the sign of a
guilty man?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The prosecution did not
prove the clothes were Mean\[CloseCurlyQuote]s, and he
did clean his truck once a week. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
hard to believe a person could murder
another and not show any signs of worry.
If you find there\[CloseCurlyQuote]s no reasonable doubt,

The defendant in the trial was acquitted of the charge that he murdered his
apartment neighbor. The victim's body was never recovered, so there was very
litie physical evidence. High school business law students served as jurors, trial
lawyers, witnesses and other members of the court in the trial.
