Sewer project deadline is now September 30

tell the board that he was responsible for
maintenance now, but that when the
project was completed, the village would
be responsible.

There was considerable discussion
about whether the problems that were

coming up were in fact maintenance,
equipment failure or related to con-
struction

The delay in completing the project
has been caused by a delay in receiving
two pumps. The pumps were supposed
to be shipped last week and trustee Dave
Thurber asked Harshman to notify him

The board voted 4-1 in favor of the
Sept. 30 deadline. Voting for the motion
were Thurber, Dwight Riley, George

Beach proposal --
goes to committee

BY CHERISE CRUIT

Enterprise Editor
The Findlay Village Board tabled a
proposal :v Bank of Findlay vice

_ president Grog Bohlen to build a beach

on property outside the village limits.

Bohlen proposes that the residents of
Findlay finance construction of a public
beach at Eagle Creek State park, and
that the beach be staffed by Shelby
County Mental Health and Rehabilitation
clients.

In presenting the proposal Monday
night, Bohlen reviewed the immediate
past history of Eagle Creek State Park.
He told the board that when the State of
Illinois closed the Lake Shelbyville
facility for two months this summer the
local economy suffered from the lack of
tourists.

He said that when the park opened in
late July, several Findlay residents were
on hand to protest for a beach. Bohlen
told the board he thought and thought
about the idea.

plausible . . . it would be a means to keep
the park open,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he stated. Bohlen said he
contacted David Kenney, Ill. Dept. of
Conservation (DOC), and Kenney was
receptive to the idea of a private source
developing a beach at Eagle Creek.

Bohlen said that in addition to the
beach area, there was additional acreage
available at Eagle Creek that could be
developed as playground, ball diamond
or picnic facilities.

It was at this point that Bohlen
proposed the union of the village of
Findlay and the Shelby County Mental
Health and Rehabilitation Board. \[OpenCurlyQuote]They
might be able to accomplish (the
project) as a joint venture.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

ing Eagle Creek for an extended
period of time could be detrimental,
Bohlen pointed out to the board. He said
that a beach at the park would almost
guarantee that the state would have to
keep the state park open.
