I think the newly oiled and rocked
roads in town look good. Some of them
might have needed tearing up before
they were oiled , but we were lucky to get
what was done done.

than I realized, and all in all it didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
make for pleasant walking.

Work is progressing nicely on the old
fire house which will soon become the

| now would be a good time to do so. The
blue and white hats that were sold during
Findlay Days are still available, and all
of the proceeds from the sale of the hats
goes to the development of the com-
munity center. So if you don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t, support

a hat.

I heard about a first grader who was
crying in the lunch line. It was found that
he was crying because there were things
on the menu he didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t like and he thought
he had to eat them all. He was happier
when he was told he could eat only the
things he liked.

I started to Bethany Saturday morning
to visit the Robinson family when my car
conveniently conked out right at the top
of the hill at Rob Winings house. I
thought I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d just turn into their drive, but I
didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have any power steering, so I had
to leave it along side the road. I had all
sorts of horrible -- like
probably I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d need a new engine or
something equally expensive. But when
Rob looked under the hood he found three
bad belts. Who else ever had three bad
belts at one time? That might be the only
thing I have against self service stations.
If no one ever looks under the hood those

up belts go unnoticed. Heaven knows, I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t

ever look under the hood, but I may start.

Bicycles after dark are a problem.
While driving two blocks last week (after
dark), I came upon three bicycles with

no lights and no reflectors. Maybe that .

So far I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve been unable to find the
results of the Kiddie Tractor Pull. If
anyone kept track of the winners I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d like
to have them for next week\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
I'd also like the results of the 10K race
held early Saturday morning.
