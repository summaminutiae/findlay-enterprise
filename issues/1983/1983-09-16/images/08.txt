Crop insurance

deadline is Sept. 30

September 30 is the last day to apply
for crop insurance for barley and wheat
in Shelby County, according to James D.
Haggard, District Director for the
Federal Crop Insurance Corporation
(FCIC).

Crop insurance covers unavoidable
loss of production from damage caused
by adverse. weather conditions, insects,
plant disease, wildlife, or fire. Insurance

coverage begins when the crop is
planted.

Producers may choose from three
coverage levels: 50-, 65-, or 75-percent of
the established farm yield for insurance
protection. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Three optional price elec-
tions for lost or
damaged also are available,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Haggard
says.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Producers of barley, wheat, oats and
rye who can qualify for a revised In-
dividual Yield Coverage (IYC) plan are
offered higher yield guarantees at no
additional cost,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Haggard says. For
information about eligibility under the
[YC plan, producers should contact an
authorized crop insurance agent well in
advance of the Sept. 30 deadline.
