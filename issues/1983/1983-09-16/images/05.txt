Hi

Heth;

such beach of this type on Lake
Shelbyville. Other beaches located at
Sullivan, She!byville and Wilborn Creek

Using the 75,000 figure and charging $1
per person to use the beach (just as an
example), Bohlen pointed out what type
of revenue the village could expect. Of
course, there would be capital cost and
operating costs, and the village would
have to split any profits from the con-
cession beach with its partner in the
venture, the mental health board.

However, Bohlen feels that with these
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]excess funds pouring in, they should be
poured back in (to the facility) and more
development could take place at this

Actually, Bohlen told the board that he
had \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]no idea at this point what the
operating costs would be.\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] He did have
some idea of how much the beach would
cost to construct.

tation that he told the board, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t

come from for this project, Bohlen said
the Bank of Findlay would probably be
receptive to the idea of issuing \[OpenCurlyQuote]beach
bonds\[CloseCurlyQuote] to the village for the project. If
the project is ever approved, tais would
be the third set of bonds for which the 800
residents of Findlay ~re responsible.
Residents have just started paying off
$450,000 worth of sewer bonds, and there
is still ten years left on bonds issued to
insta!) the natural gas delivery system.

Trustee Dave Thurber asked village
attorney Chris Eberspacher if such a
project would be legally possible.
Eberspacher said he wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t sure, but he
felt that the village lacks the authority to
issue bonds to fund a project outside the
municipality.

Eberspacher said he has told Bohlen
the proper way to proceed with the
preject probably would be to hold a
referendum asking village residents if
they would like to form a park district,
and if they are willing to pay the
district\[CloseCurlyQuote]s expenses.

MAYOR PAULINE BRINEY told
Bohlen that she had talked with Kenney,
and that funds to construct a beach at

terested in entering an agreement.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He
further stated that a lot of in depth study
needs to be done

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I don't think the village board can
condone premature releases to the
media,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Thurber further said. \[OpenCurlyQuote]! don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
think that it wos very fair\[CloseCurlyQuote] to the village.
Another trustee, Dwight Riley, said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]it
makes you look like a fool to see it first in
the paper.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

A call for a village wide vote on the
project, if the board ever decides to
pursue it further, came from board
member John Diss.

Dick Gloede of the Shelby County
Rehab Center and three of his employees
were on hand for the meeting. He said he
was just at the meeting as an observer
and that he was not committed to the
project.

Later in the meeting, Mrs. Briney
appointed Thurber, Diss and herself to a
committee to study the project further.
