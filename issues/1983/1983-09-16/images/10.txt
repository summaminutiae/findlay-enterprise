Most heating systems cost more to operate
because they have to create heat. The heat pump
simply moves heat already in the air from one
place to the other.

In winter, it actually warms your home by
gathering heat that exists in cold outside air. In
summer, it becomes an air conditioner, removing
heat from air inside your home to keep you cool.

The heat pump is highly efficient, too. It
produces about two units of heating energy for
every unit of electric energy it uses.

So, if you\[CloseCurlyQuote]re replacing your heating system, or
building a new home, consider the heat pump for
efficient, economical year-round comfort. For
more information contact your nearest CIPS
office for our booklets, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Amazing Heat
Pump,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Pump Up Savings.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
