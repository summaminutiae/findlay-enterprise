With more and more interest in no-til!
farming it has brought about more
questions this fall on fall fertilization

programs.

If you plan to fertilize this fall and you
use no-till, a system in which almost all
crop residues are left on the surface, you
can broadcast limestone,
and potassium without fear that it will be

First, you need a soil test to determine
how much needs to be applied. In no-till
fields that have had fertilizers applied to
the surface and left there, it is important
to take samples with « probe or shove! so
that the top seven or eight inches of soil is
represented in the sample. Samples of
only the top inch or two may show high
values and cause you to under estimate
your needs.

Crop residues apparently aid the up
take of phosphorus and potassium by
unproving the soil\[CloseCurlyQuote]s moisture condition

dry roughage is to place square bales,
round bales or stacks in rows that can be

covered with six mil black plastic with
the edges sealed to the ground with dirt
or ground limestone

Because part of the ammonia coming
out of a nurse tank will be in liquid form,
the usual procedure has been to place an
old livestock water tank on the ground
between the bales to serve as a reservoir
for the liqu

The pont is allowed to flow
through the three-fourths or one-inch
plastic water pipe that is flexible enough
to stick under the edge of the plastic and
be weighted down in the tank.

Ammonia will corrode the tank, so it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
a good \[OpenCurlyQuote]dea to line the tank with some of
the plastic to protect it. Flow rates of 50
to 1000 pounds of ammonia per hour
through a regulator have been used
without any problems.

The treatment level used calls for
about three percent ammonia added on 2
dry matter basis. The sealed en-
vironment needs to be maintained for a

The end results of ammoniating dry
roughage is an increase in food protein of
4 to 6 percentage units and as much as 10
percent units in digestibility. For
example, food protein may go from 4 to
10 percent and digestibility from 45 to 55
percent in ammoniated wheat straw or
corn stalks.

Wheat straw, corn stalks, and soybean
residue have been ammoniated with
os Mature fescue hay treated

with anhydrous ammonia has shown
good increase in protein, digestibility
and feed value. Apparently, any of the
mature roughages will respond to am-
monia treatment. This allows the am-
moniated mature roughages to make up
a much larger part of winter rations for

pregnant cows than untreated
roughages, because the cows eat them a
lot better and get more energy from
them

There is litte reason for ammoniation
of good quality grass or grass-legume
hay because the protein and energy
