Important Energy Saving
Steps You Can Take

All year long, you can
save money and energy

because you pay only for
the electricity you use.

Buying energy-efficient
appliances--and using
them efficiently--means
you'll use less energy.

Thorough insulation
(including weather-
stripping, caulking and
installation of storm
doors and windows) saves
energy and money both

insulation dealer can
show you what kind and
how much insulation
you'll need. :
