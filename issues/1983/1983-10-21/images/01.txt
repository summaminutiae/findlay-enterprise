In keeping with the Halloween spirit
and the Halloween events scheduled for
Findlay, Legion Post commander Fred
Tippit and Legion Auxiliary president
Pat Brooks are asking for everyone\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
help in making this Halloween a safe

October 28 set

for trick-or-treating

holiday in the community.

\[OpenCurlyQuote]Halloween is usually accompanied by
happy thoughts, but in some households
this year, the holiday will be a sad oc-
casion because of the death or injury of a
child,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Mrs. Brooks related.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Children cross dark streets or trick or
treat expeditions and many are injured
or killed by cars,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] she further related.
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Still other types of accidents happen,
such as tripping and falling due to
costumes being too long. Children also
have difficulty seeing when they wear
masks that have small slits for their
eyes.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Mrs. Brooks urged parents to consider
using costumes or stage makeup in place
of masks. Reflective tape can be applied
to arms and legs of costumes or
costumes with reflective decoration
should be used by children after dark.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Parents should see that children
never eat any treats until parents
themselves have a chance to sort through
the goodies to eliminate any suspicious
items,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] Mrs. Brooks stated.

\[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]Let\[CloseCurlyQuote]s all work together to make this a'

safe Halloween for our community,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] she
concluded.

Most of the office furniture and equipment was easy to move earlier this week when village personnel moved into new
quarters next door. The exception was the old safe -- very large, very bulky and very heavy. It took some time and effort.
but village employees Doug Ryherd and Tim Spellman, along with assistance from Gale Bricker, were able to move the
safe to its new location. The village has relocated the business office and equipment into the old fire station.
