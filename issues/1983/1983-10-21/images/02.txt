Members of the Illinois Commerce
Commission should be elected and not
appointed

It seems the appointed ones are always
on the side of the power companies. They
keep permitting the power companies to
increase rates while knowing that it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
becoming a real harship for more and
more people to pay them.

What happened is unfair to the con-
sumer. They raised the rates so we tried
to conserve so we could fit the bills into
- our budget. So we\[CloseCurlyQuote]re using less and
paying more. Taint fair in my book. They
keep advertising through the media that
they know ways to help us conserve.
What good would it do. They would just
charge us more anyway.

I'd sure hate to go back to kerosene or
gas lamps, but it may become a
necessity for some of us. I wish there was
some way to get the state and federal
government to sympathize with the
consumer on a fixed income. But how can
they when they probably have sufficient
funds to take care of their bills.

I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m sure the power companies have
some top notch lobbyists in both

sumers need lobbyists too. Judgments
should not be made on who can pay the
most money for the best lobbyists.

Now the companies are
getting into the act, and some people\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
incomes won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t permit them to pay the
extra money. So you can bet there will be
older people living alone who won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be
able to afford telephone service. That in
itself is a tragedy.--Not to worry--I
read every day that the is
getting better -- Says who? I'll believe it
when I see it.

I think we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll see the end of the tunnel
when we get some new blood in
Washington and Springfield. I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
think it could be worse. What ever party
gets in can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be worse as long as we have

a change.

I still have a possum around here
somewhere. I only see it at night, but I
wish somebody would catch it. It scares
me. Something moved the board that
covers the opening to the crawl space
under my house, so I went out and closed
it. Then not being anxious to trap a
possum in there, I open it again.

Now I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know whether the varmit is
making a home under there or not. I also
am not sure whether it might gnaw its
way into the house. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve worried about a
lot of things in my life, but I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve never
been worried about a possum before.

On two occasions I could have run over
him with my car, but I didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have the
nerve. If I had a gun and the faintest

notion of how to use it I could shoot it, but
I suppose that would be against the law
since I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know when possum hunting
season is in or even if there is one.

We're hearing a lot about the Clinton
nuclear power station again. It seems
that the number two generator will not be
needed, but millions of dollars have been
wasted on it and millions more will be.

I think the electrical company is
cheating us. They now say our electrical
rates will increase because they made a
misjudgment on how much electricity
would be needed. Now they want us to
pay for a whole bunch of mistakes. The
plant was supposed to go into operation
in 1980. Well, it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s already about four
years behind, and you can bet your last
dollar that will cost consumers also.

They didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t do a very good job on their
estimates either. In 1973 the project was
estimated to cost $800 million. In 1976 the
estimate was increased to a cost of $1.4
billion. Now they\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve decided that there\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
no need for Clinton II.

Let the stockholders pay that money.
It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s always a gamble when you buy stock
-- it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a win or lose situation, so let\[CloseCurlyQuote]s say
they lost on this one and let them pay
their own debt. The consumer doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t as
a rule have money to buy stocks, and
they sure don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have the cash to pay for
other people\[CloseCurlyQuote]s mistakes.

We pay dearly for our power now. I
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know if CIPS has any interest in the
Clinton plant or not, but I think the REA
does. Wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t it be nice if the ICC
considered the consumer now and then? I
wish the people on the ICC board would
get so they couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t pay their electrical
bills. That might AT LEAST CAUSE
them to look at both sides of the fence.

Saturday morning the Findlay

and firewomen in our case,

course, the second of three, held in
Bethany. I wonder if any of us know how
much time those people give up to keep
current on their jobs. And all for our
safety and well being. We can never
appreciate them enough.

The new community center is about
become a reality. We are the community,
so we should all be willing to help in any
way we can, be it in donations of money
or materials or in labor. What can you
do?
