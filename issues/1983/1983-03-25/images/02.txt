I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m not surprised to know there are
again pros and cons about the liquor
referendum.

If selling liquor in Findlay made a
difference in whether people drank or
not, I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d vote against it. We all know that
anyone who has a hankerin\[CloseCurlyQuote] for a nip gets
it. There\[CloseCurlyQuote]s no question as to whether
people are going to drink or not. The only
question I see is where are they going to
buy it, and to me, that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s the key question.

We all know that we have all the beer
cans strewn all over town. We also know
that we sometimes have inebriated
citizens, and we have drinking drivers.
The only thing we don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t get from the sale
of liquor is the revenue. And believe me,
we need revenue and new businesses in
this town.

I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve heard via the grapevine that if the
liquor referendum doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t pass we may
not have a grocery store. That\[CloseCurlyQuote]s because
he isn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t making enough to keep him
topside the way it is now. My opinion is
that that is the fault of community
residents -- not the grocers. How can he
stay open while so many residents of the
community go to other towns to do their
trading? It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s hard for me to believe so
many people could care so little about
this town. If the liquor referendum can
help us to have a grocery store, I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m for it.

We\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve also been promised that if it

passes, the corner building \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Ar-
ches\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] will be restored and maybe a
supper club will go in there. Well, I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d
appreciate an extra business in town,
and I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d sure appreciate that building
being restored. If it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s not restored soon, a
great landmark will untimately fall
down.
It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s not impossible to see there are
some positive sides to the issue. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve
already heard all of the often times
exaggerated negative sides, and so have
you. No, I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m not a drunk; I just happen to
love the village I live in and want to see it
have every opportunity to exist. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve
heard a couple of people say there are
other ways to bring business into town.
But they haven\[CloseCurlyQuote]t come up with viable
answers as to what else would help. You
can bet I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m open to suggestions at any
time. I think we need to do several things
to breathe new life into our community,
and the liquor issue is just the one we
might need to start with.

My grandsons were out in their
snowmobiles Sunday, but Grandma was
slipping and slidding all over the road
between Bethany and the Rob Winings\[CloseCurlyQuote]
residence. It was slick as a greased gut
when I started home, but I thought I had
enough experience on slick roads, so it

Me Thinks: 1 raive siny

didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t scare me. Well, I hadn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t gone more
than a mile or two until I was plenty
scared. Shaking in my boots I almost got
into a deep ditch two times, and I slid
sideways in the road in front of a
suburban. From then on I was more than
just scared, I was frantic. I kept thinking
if I can just make it to Rob and DeeAnn\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll be okay, but I was still a few miles
from there. Luckily I made it, and Good
Ole DeeAnn drove me home. Rob picked
her up. I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll venture out
anymore until the snow is gone, and I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m
sure it will be by the time you read this --
at least I hope so.

I didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t see the news bit on TV when
Channel 3 interviewed some peole on
what they thought about development on
the lake, but I heard that the Corps of

Engineers said we'd never been

cooperative. Now that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s what I call the
pot calling the kettle black. We\[CloseCurlyQuote]re more
cooperative than they are for one simple
reason. They write the laws, and we\[CloseCurlyQuote]re
duty bound to obey them. Sometimes I
think we were just as well off when we
had the little Kaskaskia River flowing
quietly downstream. I was anxious to see
the lake built, but I expected it to help the
financial climate in our area more than it
ever has. Development seems to be the
only possibility of helping our com-
munity. The way the government gives
to other countries for development it
wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t hurt them to give us that little
strip of shoreline. Joke, ha ha. At any
rate I do have hopes that the develop-
ment will become a reality.

Rumors never stop do they? The latest,
most ridiculous one I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve heard to date is
that if the liquor referendum passes
we're going to hire two new policemen
and pay them out of the gas fund. I also
heard this was said at a board meeting.
Not true! What would we do with three
policemen? We have one, and I think he\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
often times bored. People who quote
what was said at board meetings most
often don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know what was said there. If
they are all that interested, they should
attend the meetings that are always open
to the public.
