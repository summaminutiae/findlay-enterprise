THE BANK OF FINDLAY
ANNOUNCES A BREAKTHROUGH
IN SERVICE CHARGES

Have you checked the bottom of your checking account statement lately? Do those $5.00, $7.50, and $12.00 ser-
\[OpenCurlyQuote]vice charges your bank deducts every month bother you? If you are like the rest of us, you have better places to spend :
that money than to pay the bank for the privilege of handing your money. ;
That's why the Bank of Findlay is proud to announce this special new development in banking. ;

NO SERVICE CHARGES ON CHECKING
ACCOUNTS WITH A MINIMUM BALANCE
OF $100.00

Because we know our customers are the most valuable people in the world, we would like to treat them that way.
Let\[CloseCurlyQuote]s review the entire details of our new rate structure.

1. No service charges of any kind on accounts that maintain a minimum balance of $100.00
through the month.
2. No service charges of any kind for senior citizens, students or community groups. «.

3. For checking accounts that fall below the $100.00 minimum, a service charge of $2.50 will be
charged only if a check is drawn against your account that month.

It's too simple we realize, but we feel like it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s our responsibility to continually strive to make the best better. ;
Without things like per item charges, average balance determinations, and balance compensations, almost everyone will »
be able to figure out their monthly service charge. Maybe that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s why all of those other banks make it so complicated.

We ask you to check the bottom of your checking account statement and see how much your financial institution is
charging you for the privilege of handling your money.

We're banking on the idea that the Bank of Findlay will make more Cents for you.

P.S. If you call or stop in before April 15, we will give you a special bonus for opening an account with us.
