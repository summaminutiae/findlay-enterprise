Payments were authorized to two
contractors for the sewer project,
despite the fact that funds have not been
made available to cover all the

Protection Agency grant. Some juggling
of funds was made Monday night as the
Findlay village board authorized final
payments to one contractor and a
reduction in retainage for a second
contractor.

Division A contractor Kieffer Brothers
Construction Co. agreed to a final
payment o! $3,187. Charlie Kieffer,
speaking on behalf of his firm, agreed to
the fina: payment if the villayve would not
keep coming up with additional
problems. In return, he prom\[OpenCurlyQuote] :d that
his firm woud not charge the village
$2,686 for interest charged owed because
late payments were made.

Under the terms of Kieffer\[CloseCurlyQuote]s contract.
ina, payment was to have been made
within 45 days after compietion of the
project -- regardless of whether Findlay
had received payment from the EPA
grant. Kieffer should have received fina!
payment for installation of the sewer
system in Findlay y November.

Partial payments were authorized by
the board in previous months, and the
money was borrowed from other village
funds to make the payments. The
payments were, however, made after
tney were due. The final EPA payment
is being held up until the project is
completed, fully operational and in-
spected by the EPA.

Some problems were discussed bet-
ween the board and Kieffer, such as a
field tile collapsing and problems with
the gas lines, but the villave ayreed to
take care of these problems themselves,
and as Kieffer pointed out, can pay for

Board nixes
development

In a formal motion approved Tuesday
evening, the Moultrie County Board
rejected plans for a proposal to sell land
around Lake Shelbyville for private
development. The proposal to build
homes and commercial development
was made by Bank of Findlay senior
vice president Greg Bohlen.

The proposal had been given support
from the Shelby County Board and the
Findlay Village Board. After con-
sidering the proposal, Congressman
Dick Durbin decided last week he could
not support private sale of lakefront

property.

The Moultrie County Board rejected
the proposal citing present federal
regulations, potential pollution and
original landowners rights.

Other guests were Mary and Tina Harris

taken to court

village in a dispute that could have
