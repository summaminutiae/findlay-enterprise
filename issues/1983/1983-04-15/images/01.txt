Vol. 96 -- No. 16, Findlay, Illinois 62534

<

Just 4 votes make
liquor sales legal

Since 1941 it has been illegal to pur-
chase alcohol in Findlay. By an ex-
tremely narrow margin, voters decided
it was time for a change, and Tuesday
they voted to make liquor sales legal.

Less than 24 hours after the votes were
counted, Findlay mayor Pauline Briney
said that she had already been contacted
by individuals interested in obtaining
liquor licenses. She said that within 30
days, liquor will be on sale in Findlay.

Almost 400 Findlay residents cast
ballots in the referendum, and when the
ballots were counted Tuesday night, just
four votes made the difference. A total of
392 persons cast ballots in the municipal
election -- all but two of them on the
liquor question.

One-hundred-ninety-seven persons
voted \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]NO\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] to the question, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Shall the
sale at retail of alcoholic liquor be
prohibited in this village?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Voting
against alcohol sales (or \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]Yes\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]) were
193 individuals.

Voters in Okaw Township favored
liquor sales. They voted 105 to go wet and
85 to remain dry. Voters in Todd\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Point
Township were not in favor of the sales,
voting 108 against liquor sales and 92 in
favor.

The liquor question had not appeared
on the ballot in Findlay since the 1975
municipal election. At that time, 391
individuals voted in ihe election, and the
referendum was turned down by 36 votes.

Nearly 400 voters may possibly be a
record. In the last municipal election, in
which township officials were also
elected, approximately 250 persons cast
ballots. In that election, voters selected a
mayor, village clerk and three township
trustees.

Certificate presented

Village Trustees

Three incumbent village board
trustees were returned to office, and an
independent lost a third round bid for a
seat on the board.

The three incumbents, Larry Rodman,
Ronald McClain and David Thurber ran
on the Citizens Party Ticket. John
Cleveland, running as an independent,
lost his bid for the board.

Thurber, who was appointed to the
board in January to fill the unexpired
term of Gary Knierim, polled the most

Thurber.

Rodman, seeking his third term on the
board, received 231 votes, and McClain,
seeking his second term, polled 210 votes.

Cleveland received 194 votes.

Public Library Board, and one individual
was elected to a two year term on the
board.

Cherise Cruit, received 285 votes. New
board members and the votes they

Vadakin, 304 votes. Mrs. Jay, Mrs.
Farris and Mrs. Vadakin will replace

year term. Mrs. Hash was appointed in
February to fill the unexpired term of
Kaye Ryan.

A total of 191 ballots were cast in Okaw
Township and 201 votes were cast in
Todd\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Point Township.

John Love named
honorary EMT

William L. Kempiners, director of the
Illinois Department of Public Health,
announced Thursday that more than 300
persons through the state are being
named Honorary Emergency Medical
Technicians in recognition of their
support services and the contributions
they have made to emergency medical
services.

Findlay policeman John Love has
been named an honorary E.M.T. by
members of the volunteer Findlay
ambulance service.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Although Paramedics and other
Emergency Medical Technicians often
render dramatic life-saving services to
the people of their communties, their on-
the-scene care of the critically ill or

injured would not be possible without the
back-up assistance of dispatchers,
drivers, vehicular maintenance per-
sonnel, clerical staff and a bevy of other
support-services,\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] Kempiners said.

The certificates conferring the titles
are being presented, in local
ceremonies, as part of the observance of
Emergency Medical Week.

Governor James Thompson, in his
proclamation declaring the week of
April 10-16 as Emergency Medical
Services Week in Illinois, commended
all persons engaged in providing
emergency medical services for their
contributions to the health and well-
being of all Illinoisans.
