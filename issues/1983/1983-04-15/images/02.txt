The closing of Eagle Creek is ap-
pearing to be more stupid a!) of the time
As far as I can find oui the two state
parks in our area took in as much or
more revenue than the others. | just
heard last week that Eagle Creek took in
somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 to
60 thousand dollars. Fox Ridge near
Charleston had revenue of some $2,000
plus. Now there is $8,000 being spent to
build a riding and hiking trail there. Why
close Eagle Creek which already has the
trails and spend all of that money to build
up a park that brings in that much less
money? Truthfully, I have a feeling that
the governor is using scare tactics to get
his tax package passed, and I wonder if
he isn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t lightly tapping Mike Tate\[CloseCurlyQuote]s hands
for not voting for his tax package.
Politics is okay, but I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t approve of
using it to play games like, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]you cross
my palms, and I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll cross yours.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I hope
Representative Tate can find enough
clout somewhere to keep the park open.

Good old Dick Durbin is no match for
anybody in the Corps of Engineers, and
he could care less what happens in our
small community. Yes, he\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a Dec-
mocrat, and I worked hard for him in the
last election. In fact I still have one of his
signs on my mulberry tree. I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know
whether to tear it down or just add
another sign (uncomplimentary) to it. It
won't really break my heart if there\[CloseCurlyQuote]s no
residential development on the lake, but
I would like to see the Corps bend (fat
chance) and allow a resort to be

developed in our area of the lake. There
are many letters sent to the Findlay

fhamber of Commerce \[OpenCurlyQuote]of course we
(ont have one) asking about what mote!
or hotel facilities are available and of
course we don't have anywhere for them
to go. It could be a lot of help socially and
financially. We could even use a motel on
the lake for a convention center if the
Corps would bend another rule and allow
them to sell liquor by the drink. I don't
believe a convention would be held where
there\[CloseCurlyQuote]s no booze. The reason I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m sv
anxious about all of this is I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m getting
older everyday and I wanna see that lake
do'something for our town in my lifetime.

Usually when there\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a lake built the
size of Lake Shelbyville one could expect
it to in some measure help the area
where it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s located. Not true in this case.
It seems this one was built for tourists
and to heck with the local people. We\[CloseCurlyQuote]re
not against tourists and we appreciate
the pittance they happen to spend here,
but we are not filled with glee to be their
litterbag and we're not happy to have to
spend extra money to keep up our roads.
And we'll never be happy with the

parks is local. So why should we be asked
to spend our tax dollars on them. Let the
state and federal government pay for
them, and we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll put our taxes to a better
use. .
