uously entering and settling in a
lake does not just severely limit its
quality, for uses such as fishing, but also
by gradual filling, shortens the lake\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
life. Always, such a condition results in a
massive waste of tax dollars and an
added burden on already hard pressed
government budgets.

To help gain a better understanding of
the problem in our area, the District has
decided to cooperate with the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
(EPA) Volunteer Lake Monitoring
Program. This program relies entirely
upon local volunteers who perform

how their local lakes might be used and

At the District we are renewing our
efforts to work with all segments of the
Shelby County community to address
(and solve) the problem of soil erosion.
We recognize that the well-being of the
entire community depends upon keeping
our soil where it belongs, and the quality
of the land high. We also feel that filling
up our own lakes with topsoil makes very
little sense. Anybody with some time to
spare and similar concerns for our area
should contact the Soil and Water Con-
servation District Manager at 774-5561
for further details on how you can help
conserve \[OpenCurlyQuote]your\[CloseCurlyQuote] resources.

Films available from CIPS

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Money, Money, Money,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] a new film
available from Central Illinois Public
Service Co., examines the role of money
in today\[CloseCurlyQuote]s society and how its control
affects the world.

A second film, also available, \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The
Jackie Robinson Story,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] provides a look
at one of baseball\[CloseCurlyQuote]s greatest players and
the first black man to play in the major

leagues.

The documentary on money points out
that money is the symbolic standard that
allows us to compare the value of dif-
ferent items. It demonstrates how
purchases give producers the money to
pay workers and other expenses in ad-
dition to the tax dollars which pay for
roads, hospitals, police, schools, and
other government functions.

The film provides a look at the Federal
Reserve System, which regulates and
standardizes money. The cameraman
also shows how money circulates
through the nation\[CloseCurlyQuote]s financial institutions
and how the government controls the
economy by regulating the flow of
money.

A highlight of the film is an interview
with Robert Hutchinson, vice president
of Manufacturer\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Hanover Trust
Company, who explains the complex
problems of transferring money in a
huge industrial economy.

The cameraman shows a display of the

number of checks written in a year -- up
to 35 billion 7 how they are
processed after deposited.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Jackie Story\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] traces

the ballplayer\[CloseCurlyQuote]s life, how he got into
baseball in 1945 with the Montreal
Monarchs of the Negro League and how
he was signed by the Dodgers and sent to
the Montreal Royals, the Dodgers top
farm club.

Historic footage depicts some of the
reactions from fans when he began
playing with the Dodgers and how he
overcame the prejudices and became a
major part of the baseball world.

These two films and other current
event films and science-related films
may be scheduled free of charge through
the nearest CIPS office.
