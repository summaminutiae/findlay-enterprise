Twister time in Illinois

The tornado season has arrived in
Illinois.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Tornadoes with long tracks -- that is,
whose paths are more than 25 miles in

its share of long-track tornadoes.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

One such long-track tornado occurred
on March 18, 1925. It cut a swatch one-
half to one mile wide and 219 miles long
through Mississippi, Illinois and Indiana,
killing 695 people and injuring 2,000.

Another tornado on May 26, 1917, called
the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Mattoon-central Illinois tornado,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
cut 293 miles through Illinois and In-
diana, leaving 101 people dead and 693
injured

Such tornadoes constitute one class of
tornadic activity in the state. The other
type consists of storms that produce
several tornadoes in a few hours.

The central United States is a major
breeding ground for tornadic storms
mainly because of moisture that cir-
culates northward from the Gulf of
Mexico and the strong weather distur-
bances that move eastward from the
Rockies, he said. The moisture moves
northward at low levels -- from zero to
10,000 feet -- and reacts with cold fronts
brought eastward by upper-air
movements,

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]When you get all that together, you
end up with thunderstorms and severe
thunderstorms that can produce tor-
nadoes,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] he said. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s what makes this
eight-state area the tornado capital of the
world.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]

The National Weather Service issues
tornado watches for areas where tor-
nadoes could develop and tornado
warnings when a tornado is sighted.

The survey recommends the following
if a tornado is seen or reported nearby, or
if a community warning system is
sounded:

Stay away from outer walls and
windows, and use a storm cellar if
