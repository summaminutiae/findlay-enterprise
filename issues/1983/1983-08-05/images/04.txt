Remodeling Work in continuing on turning the old fire station into the new Findlay Village
Hall. Village employees are doing most of the work and funds for the project

were allocated out of Revenue Sharing. The old village hall will be turned into a

community center. The Findlay Community Club is sponsoring a benefit tonight

(Friday) to help pay for some of the remodeling costs. The benefit is a pork

dinner -- with entertainment -- to start at 4:30 p.m. at the high school. Be
