Parentless children spoil \[OpenCurlyQuote]Princess\[CloseCurlyQuote]

by Bill Hoban
News-Progress staff writer
The tue Tien
Theatre\[CloseCurlyQuote]s production of
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Princess and the Pea\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] by Michele
Vacca was an enjoyable play -- when it
could be heard.

With an estimated 400 children in at-
tendance, the theatre was noisy. More
than one of the actors said it was rough at
times hearing cues from the other per-
formers because of the din. There were
not many adults in the audience, and it
seemed like a lot of parents dumped their
children at the theatre instead of ex-
periencing theatre with them.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Princess and the Pea\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] is an
original play by Vacca which had 30
minutes chopped so it would fit the hour-
long slot scheduled for children\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
theatre. Vacca and her husband, Bob
Boburka, have produced the play at their
playhouse in Chicago. She wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t sure if
the play contained many of the lines from
her original script because of the lack of
time for rehearsal by the interns who put
the production on.

The play involves a prince, Valiant,
played by Paul Ganus, who goes out
looking for a princess to be his wife.
Along the way he runs into various
princesses who could be best described
as space cadets. When he does find the
princess he wants to marry, she must
pass a test administered by Valiant\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
grandmother. When the princess passes
the test, as we all knew she would, the
two are allowed to marry and
presumably live happily ever after.

The cast, which includes locals Angela
Gore, Amanda Howen and Gretchen
Rasmussen, did a good job despite the

Ganus, as Valiant, does a good job and
seems to have fun roaming over the set
from \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Something's Afoot.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] David Renar
as Valiant'\[CloseCurlyQuote]s footman Donald the Dunce is
funny. Both Ganus and Renar are on
stage most of the time.

Most of the other characters make
brief David Sinkus is the
King who sends his son Valiant out on the
search for a princess. Marcia Macomber
is Granny, and she adminsters the test to
the princess

Along the way, Valiant meets some

princesses -- but is not really enchanted
with Beulah the Beautiful, Gore;
Minerva the Marvelous, Howen; and
Stella the Strong, Monica McCain.

As the play progresses, the jesters,
Rasmussen and Greg Stiff, give a run-
