often on T.V. Some loan company gives
the pitch that people should borrow
money from the company on their homes
so they can have all the money they want

Tonight is the night of the kickoff
dinner for the benefit of a new com-

evening\[CloseCurlyQuote]s entertainment at a very
reasonable cost. If you\[CloseCurlyQuote]re unable to go,
make a donation anyway. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a good
cause. Something the whole community
can use.
