The Browns have used the
EQUALIZER, our plan-ahead
payment plan, for two years.
Jim says leveling out their
energy bills, especially during
the higher summer rate period,
is a real convenience.

Nancy says knowing in advance
what their energy payments will
be takes the guesswork out of
planning the family budget.

The higher summer rates will
continue through September.
This is a good time to sign up
for the EQUALIZER. .

With the EQUALIZER you can:

® Make equal monthly
payments.

* Eliminate guesswork in
planning your energy
payments.

® Sign up any time of the year.

If you decide to take advantage
of the EQUALIZER, your level
payments will start with the
next month\[CloseCurlyQuote]s bill.

Contact your CIPS office. We'll
be happy to give you details,
including the booklet, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Ask us
