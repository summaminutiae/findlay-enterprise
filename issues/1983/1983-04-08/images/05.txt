Wooters Sports Shop and the Bank of Findlay played host Tuesday to a
television camera crew from Japan. The production crew, accompanied by
television star and reporter Sherri (Reiko) Abi, were in Findlay to film a segment
for a popular Japanese television program about the bank's recent \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]guns for
interest\[CloseCurlyQuote] promotion. Findlay\[CloseCurlyQuote]s star for the television seqment was Harold
Macklin, who learned he was a star about 9 a.m. Tuesday morning. He will be
seen by 10,000,000 Japanese television viewers. The bank promotion is of
interest to the Japanese because they are not allowed to own guns. Except for
an intrepreter who has lived in Los Angeles for ten years, the production crew
was not able to speak English.
