Hog farmers learn ways to avoid spread of disease

losses among young pigs.
THE DISEASE, WHICH is called

\[OpenCurlyQuote]mad itch\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] in cattle and sheep, quickly
runs its course in these species since it is
almost 100 percent fatal. But hogs
recover in some instances and also build
an immunity to the disease. However,
hogs also can harbor the herpes virus
which causes the disease and pass it
along to well pigs. Transmission of the
disease is about 95 percent from hog to
hog with transmission by wild animals,
humans and feedstuffs accounting for the
rest.
Dr. Beal said that maintaining strict
isolation and strict sanitation procedures
are the best ways of keeping the disease
off currently disease free farms.

He said that animals purchased for
breeding purposes should be isolated for
30 days which should give time for any
clinical symptoms of the disease to
appear. He noted that a required blood
test for pseudorabies is good for 60 days
and that infection can occur within that
time span.

He also cautioned about visiting
neighbors whose herds are infected and
urged that boots and coveralls worn
while around or handling stranges hogs
be changed and sanitized before they are
worn onto the home hog lot.

FOR THOSE WHO HAVE the disease
on the farm, Dr. Beal suggested that
dead animals be burned or buried to
prevent the spread of disease to domestic
dogs and cats and to wildlife. He cited an

affects owner

The quarantine placed by the
Illinois Dept. of Agriculture on
swine infected with pseudorabies
is actually an order to the owner or
possessor of the animals
specifying that none of the animals
are to be sold for feeding or
breeding purposes. Violation of the
Quarantine order is a
misdemeanor.

According to Dr. Paul Spencer of
the IDOA, when all the animals
have been marketed, the premises
can be disinfected with chemicals,
but suggested that a steam
cleaner, usually used to clean auto
and tractor engines, is the best
thing to use. The herpes virus that
is responsible for pseudorabiess is
intolerant of high temperatures.

The quarantine is unique in that
most quarantines placed for
control of livestock diseases affect
all animals within a specific
geographic location.

1. Changing management within the
swine industry (intensification of
housing). Pseudorabies is most

pseudorabies.

3. Increased awareness of the disease.

There is also speculation that the virus
may have changed or that a new strain of
virus came to a place of prominence in
the environment in the 1970's.

THERE ARE BOTH killed and
modified live virus vaccines that can be
used to stop economic losses in infected
swine herds, but the vaccine does not
stop the hogs from being carriers of the
disease. Therefore herds in which
vaccination programs are in effect are
placed under quarantine and hogs may
be shipped for slaughter purposes only.

A vaccinated healthy hog also tests
positive for pseudorabies and this makes
the actual detection and isolation of the
disease all that much more difficult for
federal and state officials attempting to
control its spread.

A considerable amount of tax money is
being spent on pseudorabies. According
to Spencer, more than $100,000 a year is
being spent by the state of Illinois for
testing along at laboratories in
Galesburg and Centralia. Presently the
U.S. Dept. of Agriculture is considering
matching $100,000 from the National
Pork Producers Assn. with an additional
$400,000 to develop and test preventative
vaccines. :

At present the optimum method of
cleaning a farm where the disease has
been found is to remove all hogs from the
premises, disinfect everything with
either high acid or high alkali cleaners
and leave the premises vacated until any
remaining virus had died.

The virus can live for up to 120 days
when the temperture is about 40 degrees
F., and 40 days at 98.6 degrees F. In most
cases, though, the virus probably sur-
vives only a few days outside the host

Research at Iowa State University
indicates the virus lives only a few hours
on clean concrete and that it survives for
up to three days on plastic and steel. It
will survive in soil for up to six days, in
lagoon water up to two days and also up
to two days in manure.
