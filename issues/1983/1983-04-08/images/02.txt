Show that you have an interest in your
town. Vote Tuesday, April 12. Remember
if you don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t care enough to vote you don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
get to complain.

The letters to the editor last week held
interesting statistics about alcohol, but
remember, those national statistics
include Chicago's Skid Row, Harlem and
a lot of other places that don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have a
hooting thing to do with Findlay. We who
are for the liquor referendum passing
are not able or liable to cause people to
drink. Everyone knows whether they are
drinkers or non drinkers.

The fact is that whether or not the
Village is voted wet or dry will not cause
people who want to drink not to drink or
vice versa. If keeping Findlay dry would
cause people not to drink I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d be the
second Carrie Nation. The idea is not
whether or not some people choose to
have a nip now and then. We aren\[CloseCurlyQuote]t going
to stop them.

No one can deny that the town needs
new businesses and revenue. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll say it
one more time. We already have people
drinking and driving. We already have
illegal transportation of liquor. We have
beer cans slung all over town. The only
thing we don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t get is the revenue, so if we
have to put up with the bad part we might
as well have the good part.

In my opinion the biggest market
would be the campers. Those who choose
to drink while vacationing are going to
buy their liquor somewhere. They will
also buy their groceries, gas, etc. where
they have access to liquor, so if we\[CloseCurlyQuote]re
going to sit in the heart of the lake it
would be nice if we gained some bit of
profit from those who use the lake
facilities.

I would hope that some time in the
future we might have other ways to add
to revenue from campers, boaters,
fishermen and who ever. So many
Findlians have chosen not to trade in
their town that to have any business we
have to a degree depends on those who
travel through here.

Sid King, the owner of our only grocery
store, has already said that getting a
liquor license seems to be his last hope to
keep the grocery store open. We\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve also
been promised that the Arches building
will be restored and we'll have a new
business there if a liquor license is
available. Personally, I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t expect to
see a town full of drunks or a lot of
related problems, and I would love
seeing business coming into town for a
change -- instead of going out.

I love this village and would hate te see

- each meal,

it die on the vine, and that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s exactly
where we're headed if we don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t make
some kind of change. A few people can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
save it. It will take all of us, and if you

well throw in the towel -- but I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m a long

lot of ways it can be done. Probably the
best way if you want to build is to buy
here what can be bought here. Findlay
First. You'll have plenty of chances to
get out of town to buy things that can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be
bought here. If it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a fit place to live it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a
fit place to shop.

Back to the liquor referendum -- vote
your conscience. I wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t attmpt to tell
anyone how to vote even though Bob
Ramshaw said I made people vote my
way. That\[CloseCurlyQuote]s not true. I couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t even it I
wanted to. However you choose to vote on
any issue is your business, but I'd love to
see every voter at the polls Tuesday.
Show your interest in your home town by
voting. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m not endorsing any candidates
in this column, but I intend to vote \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]NO\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
on the liquor issue, and that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a vote for
the referendum. Remember if you want
to vote for the referendum, vote \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]No.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] If
you want to vote against it vote \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Yes.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
Sounds a bit crazy, but that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s the way it
is. Vote your way and I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll vote mine. Just
make it to the polls Tuesday and VOTE.
