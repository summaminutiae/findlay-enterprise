Village, library trustees to be selected

Residents of the village of Findlay will
go to the polls Tuesday to elect three
village board trustees, six public library
board trustees and decide on whether or
not to allow liquor sales.

In the race for village board seats, four
persons are vying for three open slots.
Incumbents Larry Rodman and Ron
McClain, Dave Thurber, who is filling out
the unexpired term of Gary Knierim, and
John Cleveland are seeking village
trustee positions.
Cleveland, who is running as an in-
dependent, is an employee of the
Caterpillar Tractor Co. He has been a
resident of the community since 1964 and
is married to the former Sherry
Coventry. They have one daughter,
Rhonda, a student at Findlay High
School

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]T would like to take an active roll in
city government,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Cleveland stated,
because he likes living in Findlay. He is a
veteran of the Vietnam War, belongs to
the Clarence Bixler American Legion
Post of Findlay, was a volunteer fireman
for the Findlay Fire Protection District
for ten years and was also a member of
the Shelby Co. Sheriff's Auxiliary for one
and a half years. He collects antique
radios as a hobby.

Thurber, 33, has lived in Findlay for six
years with his wife Donna and their two
sons, Chris and Jeff, who are students at
Findlay Grade School. Born in Vermont,
he was graduated from Belfast High
School in Maine and attended Nor-
theastern University in Boston and Lake
Land College. He is an Air Force veteran
and has been employed by the Illinois
Consolidated Telephone Co. for the past
14 years as material control and
equipment repair supervisor.

A Findlay volunteer fireman since
1977, Thurber was recently certified as
an emergency medical technician. He is
a trustee of Faith Lutheran Church of
Sullivan and has taught data processing
for Lake Land College. Thurber was
appointed in January to fill the unexpired
term of Gary Knierim. Since that time he
has been the gas commissioner, actively

helping with the sewer project and has
worked as a liason with First Rural
Cable Television to bring cable television
to Findlay.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]T\[CloseCurlyQuote]d just like to see people proud that
they live in Findlay. I enjoy living in
Findlay and would like to see the town
prosper as opposed to going any other
direction. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m willing to put my time and
effort into keeping Findlay a place to live
as we know it now and with any possible
improvement,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Thurber stated.

Rodman has served eight years on the
village board and has filled the post of
terms. Rodman, 33, is married to the
former Marlene Minor. They have two
daughters, Laura and Leslie. He is a
graduate of Findlay High School and has
been a resident of the community for
nine years. He is a construction worker
and a veteran of the Vietnam War.

Rodman is a member of the Findlay
American Legion Auxiliary and formerly
served as an emergency medical
technician and a volunteer fireman.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]My main concern is the upcoming
liquor referendum. I am in favor of it
passing and hope it will generate jobs for
local people. It could be a stepping stone
for growth for the village. I would expend

any effort to see Findlay grow,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] Rodman.

stated. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I'll run on my record.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Rodman
also voiced his support for village
policeman John Love, \[OpenCurlyQuote]We have a good
policeman who can communicate with
the younger generation or people of any
age.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

McClain has served on the village
board since 1979. He served two years as
water commissioner and two years as
sewer commissioner. McClain, 30, and
his wife, Brenda, have three children,
Mendi, Marcie and Ronnie. He has been
a resident of Findlay for 20 years and is a
graduate of Findlay High School. He is
employed by Anderson Electric of
Springfield and is presently working at
the Kincaid Power Plant. He is a
member of the Findlay American

Legion.

Wet or dry? voters to decide

For the first time in eight years,
Findlay village residents will go to the
polls Tuesday to decide whether or not to
allow liquor sales within the village
limits.

The last time the issue was on the
ballot, in 1975, voters turned down the
sale of alcohol by a wide margin. At the
time, only 150 voters favored liquor
sales, and 229 were opposed.

The vote was closer four years earlier,
in 1971, when the issue was on the ballot
and lost by a slim margin -- just 36 votes.
The previous wet-iry referendum was 30
years before that, in 1941. In that
referendum, 144 voters cast ballots for
liquor sales, and 207 voters cast ballots
against the sale of alcoholic beverages.

On the portion of the ballot listing the
liquor referendum question, voters
should take careful note of the form of
the question. Voting \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]yes\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] means the
voter favors Findlay remaining dry, and
voting \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]no\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] means the voter favors
liquor sales in Findlay.

The exact question, as it appears on the

ballot prepared by Shelby County Clerk
Dwight Campbell, is: \[OpenCurlyQuote]Shall the sale at
retail of alcoholic liquor be prohibited in
this village?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] In the last election in-
volving the liquor question, there were
nine spoiled ballots.

The Findlay village board has taken
some action on drafting a proposed
liquor ordinance. The board directed
village attorney E.C. Eberspacher III to
prepare an ordinance so that residents of
the community would have some idea
what type of establishments would be
allowed to sell liquor if the April 12
referendum passes.

Under terms of the proposed ordinance
five liquor licenses would be issued: one
for a restaurant; two for package liquor
sales and two for clubs. There would be
no liquor licenses issued to taverns.

If the liquor referendum passes, the
mayor, Pauline Briney, will take on the
additional duty of acting as liquor
commissioner. She will have the
authority to both grant the liquor licenses
and to revokethem.
