End result doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t

The hankerin\[CloseCurlyQuote] for a nip starts in one\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
mind and is not self-controlled. Anyone is
a drunkard, but only with the action of

you think?

The positive side of the issue is not
impossible. So here is the positive side of
a drunk who has a car wreck and is in the
hospital: 1. Liquor sales revenue to
Findlay. 2. A salesman sells a new car. 3.
The doctor and hospital get the work. 4.
One who needs the work gets the drunk\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
job. I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t like this positive side; no
happiness or feeling of joy in this. The
total cost of liquor sales is too high.

And I do not like booze and groceries
sold side by side in a grocery store; it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
the children! Groceries are the food for
life, but liquor with no self-control is a
sinful nature and death. But to the
children's eyes and mind it (booze and
groceries) can all look good, okay and all
needed! After-all, it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s all sold side by
side. What we do is what our minds are
renewed to and action taken on it.

Vote \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]yes,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] punch booze sales out of
Findlay, punch 69 on ballot! Question on
ballot, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Shall the sale at retail of
alcoholic liquor be prohibited in this
village?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Voter, counsel with your spirit and soul
and take action. Go VOTE yes, punch 69
on the ballot. This referendum will be
decided by the voter that votes only, so
vote and vote your spirit and soul. I urge
loving prayers by all for all each day.
Jesus is Lord!

Thank you,

Writer can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t decide

liquor question

Something to think about before you
cast your vote on the wet or dry issue.

I understand if the vote is dry that
there will be no exception to the law. So
will it do away with the two organizations
that give us the Findlay Days and
Halloween doings, etc?

I can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t see that this vote has anything
to do with the religious matter. I can
show you church organizations that drink
wine. I can show you \[OpenCurlyQuote]church
organizations that say it is sinful to drink
wine and may lead someone to
alcoholism.

I think all of us contribute in one way or
another in the handling of alcohol. Raise
it, sell it, buy it, drink it, so if we can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
control ourself and our children,in what
is wrong and what is right, we will
destroy each other anyhow.

Do you think a child or anyone else will
make a true decision about smoking or
drinking when he is told by his master
that it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s sinful or not healthy to use it, and
they see tobacco and liquor in the
master\[CloseCurlyQuote]s pockets and home.

If you are a true Christian, I can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t see
you voting either way. It scares me
whatever the outcome is, \[OpenCurlyQuote]wet or dry.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
Will the farmers be cut off from raising
grain? Will we be cutting off our own
hands that feed the face, or will we be

waiting in line for a drunk to come along
and do it. If I had my choice, I will wait
for the drunk.

I am not concerned about the money. I
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t care if a bottle of beer cost $20 or a
package of tobacco cost $50. What I am
concerned about is it safer to haul the
liquor into this town or from this town.
An alcoholic is going to travel as far as
possible to get it.

Question No. 1. Would you have
married your husband or wife if he or she
were black or you were blind? Think
about it before you answer that one.

Also, you can answer this one for me
for, I haven\[CloseCurlyQuote]t found the answer yet today.
This is a true story about my grand-
parents. One day I drove them to church
because they were getting too elderly to
drive. While the sermon was going on, I
sat there and watched my grandma and
grandpa get down on their hands and
knees and pray. While praying they
crawled around so long that they couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
get up. Grandmother\[CloseCurlyQuote]s knees were black
and blue, so I had to help them get up and
put them in the car.

On the way home I asked grandmother
why she had done such a crazy thing. She
said that it was the holy spirit in them.
After making a few other remarks she
asked me what kind of spirit I had in me
when I was playing basketball a few
nights ago and she was watching for the
first time in her life, watching me fall
down a few times and getting hurt and
the crowd clapping their hands and
hollering. Yet today, I can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t answer that
one. But I do know that I wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t on drugs
or alcohol, and I learned a lesson at the
time never make anymore crazy
remarks about any religion.

I am not asking you to vote either way
for I haven\[CloseCurlyQuote]t made up my mind myself to
even vote. So before you vote think about
the two questions that I asked about, the
marriage and what did grandmother
want to hear.

If you have the answer then tell me to
vote and how.

Yours,
William H. Rosine

Liquor could help

business climate

To the citizens of Findlay:

Having lived here in Findlay for
nearly 20 years, I cannot understand
why certain people are opposed to much
needed change in our liquor law.

The business climate in our city is as
sure as you agree, very poor.

When we go to the polls Tuesday the
12th, ask yourself these questions, do
any of you have a magic formula for
increasing our population, upgrading
our business climate, improving our
roads and gathering revenue from our
much traveled lake area?

Although by making this change in our
liquor law, it is by no means a magic
formula, but this is a start to improving
drastically the above conditions.

People, Findlay needs the revenue to
keep going. Instead of thinking about
your own opinion about liquor, why don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
you think about the good of the city for a
change. I am!

Grocery store

needs liquor sales

I was very impressed to see how much
research was done on the liquor issue. I
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t doubt any of the facts stated and
the right to say it. I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t see where
having liquor legally in Findlay. will

FINDLAY ENTERPRISE--FINDLAY, ILLINOIS 62534

change any of the figures. If people want
to drink they will get it some where.

Liquor in town
may save lives

To whom it may concern,

I have heard the argument of whether
or not the Village of Findlay should or
should not have a liquor license. The
only difference there will be with Fin-
diay having liquor, is the village will get
the extra income from the sale.

Another benefit is that it might save
someone from Findlay going out of town
and getting tanked up and trying to drive
home and maybe getting killed or maybe
killing himself and someone else out on
the road.

Myself, I do not drink, but I cannot see
what harm there is in having the village
benefit from the business that will be
generated by the sale of liquor. There
will not be any more drunk in or around
Findlay than there is right now. Beer is
sold here right now so why not the
village get the benefits from the sale of
it?
