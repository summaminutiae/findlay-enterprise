Riley and board member, George
Carter, spoke up for Rankin saying that
both felt he was keeping accurate
records. |

McClain said that the board decided at
a meeting last year that each depart-
ment would be accurately charged for
the correct amount of employee time.

Riley defended the division of salary
expenses, pointing out that he has spent
time with village employees and knows

out that because the village operates its
own gas system, the Illinois Commerce
Commission requires by law for them to
employee a person full time.

Mrs. Briney said that without that
requirement, the village might possibly
be able to get by with only two em-
ployees.
