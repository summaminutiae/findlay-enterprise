I have suggestions that came from a
suggestion box in the restaurant. The box
was put there by a Findlian and was to be
used for suggestions on ways to help
Findlay grow. One said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]LOWER THE
WATER AND SEWER RATES.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] That
sounds good, but right now that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s im-
possible. Another said \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]You should build
a park in this town for the kids to play,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
and the third said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I think the liquor
permit should be allowed so that we can
receive the revenue, etc.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] That one was
evidently written before the liquor
referendum passed. The fourth one said,
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Turn. Findlay into a complete tourist
center . Cater to
campers and recreation during the whole
year, but expecially off months -- push
crafts, hobbies and skill center for
Central Illinois.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Sounds like a good idea
doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t it?

In a conversation with a Decatur
salesman last week he suggested we hold
Saturday night square dances. He said
there are a lot of campers who enjoy
Square dancing. We probably need more
suggestions. What\[CloseCurlyQuote]s yours?

I guess my suggestions would be to try
to get the governor to keep Eagle Creek
open and for the dictating Corps of
Engineers to allow a resort area south of
the bridge or near the Findlay Marina.

Fox Ridge State Park near Charleston
doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t seem to be in danger of being
closed by the governor, yet the receipts
for that park amounted to a measly
$3,379.50 during 1982. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve been told that
receipts for Eagle Creek Park were
about $50 to $60 thousand dollars. What
sense does it really make to close the
Eagle Creek Park? I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve also been
reminded that the Mattoon paper stated
that $8,000 is being spent to build hiking
and riding trails at Fox Ridge. Now if you
think that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s not politics, I do, since
somebody said to me, \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]Sure that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s in Jim
Edgars\[CloseCurlyQuote] area. Well we\[CloseCurlyQuote]re supposed to
have Rep. Mike Tate and Sen. James
Rupp in our corner and I expect some
action from them.

According to the calendar, Spring\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
Sprung, and the robins have sung, but it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
winter yet. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m sick of the below normal
temperatures we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve had and sick of the
above normal precipitation. It was
warmer at Christmastime than it has
been recently. Surely it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s gotta get
better. Probably the main reason I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m
waiting for warmer weather is that I
want the gas bills to do down.

I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m making a resolution to quit eating

New league

seeks donations

Letter to the Editor, .

I would like to inform the Findlay
community that we have formed a new
city recreation department; we have
elected officers and have set up a
banking account that funds will be put
into

We will report to the village board
monthly of our progress. We have the
full support of the school board and will
work closely with them.

If you or any organization wants to
donate to this fund just make a check out
to Findlay Recreation Department. |
will see that your contribution is: ac-
counted for.

Our first step is to install a good
lighting system and build a permanent
fence around the ball diamond. We are
interested in a small mobile shed that
can be used for a food stand. If anyone
has a shed that could be converted into
such, please get in touch with me. We
may ask for bids to run the stand on a
percentage basis.

We would like to make this program
self supported. If anybody is just in-
terested in doing con-
tact me, and I will find a job for you. It is
to your benefit just as much it will be to
me, after all it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a plan to do something
for the kids.

Our first week after organization the
interest is flying mighty high, and that is
a good sign that the program might
work. We also have four men\[CloseCurlyQuote]s ball
teams and have three
tournament dates already spoken for. So
you ladies had better start organizing
and pick a night to do your thing. I will
have forms made up and pass out to the
school children so they can sign up and
have a two or three or etc. league made
up of all ages in the slow pitch softball.

Letters to the editor

We will have a meeting in the next few
days so we can start scheduling the use
of the diamond. If you have any
questions, see me.

St. Pat's dance

was great

Letter to the Editor,

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Better late than never,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] but I would
like to compliment the Findlay
Jaycettes and Jaycees for the St.
Patricks Day dance they sponsored for
the young people within the community.
I know the young people appreciate a
place to go and have fun without costing
a lot. The good music, food, drink and
chaperones were just the right touch for
a nice evening of fun. Thanks for your
concern and effort. I hope you will
continue to think of them and will be able
to plan more dances.

to \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Methinks\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

We would like to take exception to the
statement of. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Methinks\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] that a \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]con-
vention would not be held where there is
no booze.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

We have attended state conventions
with 100-200 people in attendance. Also
several international conventions with
1,000-1,300 registered. The meetings
close with a beautiful, impressive church
service prepared and presented by the
teens and juniors of our organization.

Since our conventions are family
oriented, the criteria for choosing a hotel
is not, booze, but a swimming pool and
facilities for the teens and juniors.

Making the above statement is equal to
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]everyone says or does it.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
