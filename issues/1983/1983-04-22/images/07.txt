In Memory of Merle Heiland

Paul told the Corinthians, \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]There
are three things that remain -- faith,
hope, and love, and the greatest of
these is love.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I Cor. 13:13.

Sometimes it takes special oc-
casions to make some people realize
the love they have within their
hearts. Others can see this love in
many different ways and in many
different occasions.

Love is a very important part of a
family and is something not easily
forgotten.

To realize the love we had for her
is not just to remember her once a
year, but everytime we are in the
ee of her endless momories of
ove.

She had this kind of love for us,
and we certainly have this lasting
love for her.

The Electric Heat Pump:
A system for all seasons.

The heat pump is a highly efficient system that
runs entirely on electricity. In winter, it takes heat
from the outside air and \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]pumps\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] it inside to keep
you warm. In summer, it takes heat from the air
inside your home and \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]pumps\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] it outside so you
can keep cool.

You'll like its heating efficiency, since it
produces about two units of heat energy for each
unit of energy it uses. And, it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s also an efficient air
conditioner. Truly, a system for all seasons.

1. Heat is obtained
from outside air.
2. Heat-transfer
fluid carries heat
to indoor unit. RO Re Ng
3. Circulating indoor | =
air picksup heat
and carries it
throughout home.

1. Heat is removed
from indoor air.

2. Heat-transfer
fluid carries heat
to outdoor unit.

3. Heat is expelled
to the outdoors.

Investigate the year-round
comfort of an efficient,
electric heat pump. For
