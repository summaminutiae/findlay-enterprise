Two leagues could cause conflict

By Cherise R. Cruit

The Findlay Summer Baseball
Organization has been running the
orograni for several years. Volunteers
nave staffed teams, the school district
provided the ball diamond and the
village board paid the utility bill to light
the diamond.

Now, a new league, the Findlay
Recreation League has been created,
and it appears that their goal is to
upgrade the ball diamond to ac-
commmodate slow pitch softball men\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
leagues.

The two leagues appear to be on a
collision course which will see a conflict
for playing ball -- the Findlay High
School ball diamond.

C omm unity center prop osed

By Cherise R. Cruit

A proposal was made to the Findlay
village board April 11 by a group of
citizens interested in turning the village
hall into a community center.

At the March 14 village board meeting,
the board voted to remodel the old fire
station, which was vacated by the
Findlay Fire Protection District in
January. Funds for the remodeling are
to come from revenue sharing, and the
work will be done by village employees.

Findlay United Methodist Church, acted
as spokesman for the group making the

as a senior citizen and youth center.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We will organize if you approve,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he
told the board. Board member

Riley questioned who would be

responsible for utilities and insurance. It
was not made clear at the board meeting
whose responsibility this was.

However, the board appeared to be i in

Part of the building -- the office space
currently utilized by village treasurer
Joan Lucas -- will continue to be
reserved by the village for the use of
policeman John Love.

During the discussion, one member of
the audience -- Bill Rosine -- questioned
the ownership of the new village hall. He
understood that the building was built
with donations. Village Clerk Mike
Hartman \[OpenCurlyQuote]clarified ownership, telling
Rosine that the village built the facility

with revenue sharing funds during his
tenure as mayor. Some volunteer labor
was used when it was constructed.

There was also some question about
whether the Findlay Public Library
Board would be interested in the facility.
A member of the library board, Cherise
Cruit, pointed out that as a result of the
April 12 general election there would be
three new board members and a
decision to move was being left to the
new board.

The building can be operated as a
community center. Funds to pay for
utilities and insurance can be obtained
by tax levy. However, such a levy must
be approved by voters before it can be
applied. )

IN OTHER ACTION, the board
reviewed trouble with dogs, a perennial
problem. Rosine asked if there was any
recourse for a nei dog that
barked all day long and got all the other

dogs in the area barking. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It gets on
your nerves,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] he said.

Village attorney E.C. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Chris\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
Eberspacher advised Rosine to contact
Shelby County State\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Attorney Glen
Wright about the problem.

In an unrelated matter, the board

discussed a pending court case regar-
ding unleashed dogs. Mayor Pauline
Briney wanted to drop the case since the
dog owners have since given away- the
animals. Board member Larry Rodman
was adamant in prosecuting the case, \[OpenCurlyQuote]I
want to enforce it,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he stated. Eber-
spacher will pursue the case.

The board also seemed to be in favor of
raising the fee to release dogs that have
been picked up by village employees.
Currently the fee is $10 and several felt
that this was not enough of a deterrent
for people to tie up their dogs. At times,
the dog owner pays the fee and turns
