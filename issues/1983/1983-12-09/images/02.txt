I heard about a new club. and I'm
gonna join. The name of the organization
is PPP (Pudgy People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Problems.) I
hope I get the help I need. Sometimes I
think the only way I could lose much
weight is to have an absolutely bare
refrigerator and not go out of the house.
But I'm anxious to see what the club has
to offer. Maybe they can give me some
incentive. I hope so!

On second thought I may not join until
after the holidays. That\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a heck of a time
to have to diet. Mostly I think of dieting
when it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s time to go to the doctor for a
check up. I tried refusing to get on the
scales but found that impossible so far. I
told him once that after 30 years of going
to the same doctor I should be able to
have my way once, but he said that was a
\[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]No no,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and I lost the brief argument.

One lady told me this week that she
didn't think the new stop signs would
work. She said as she came into town
from the north she stopped at the sign,
and without realizing she was going too
fast found she'd speeded up to 35 miles
per hour before she reached the grade
school. I still think a School Zone light in
the right place would have worked
better.

Have you made your contribution to
the Ashli Bunch fund at the Bank of
Findlay yet? There's a real need for that
fund. Ashli returned home from St.
John\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Hospital in Springfield last
Thursday, and her mother told me that
she also has too many electrical impulses
in the brain that causes her to have
siezures. Everyone fortunate enough to
have healthy children should be able to
donate to this family. Big or little
donations both help. And there\[CloseCurlyQuote]s money
needed NOW!

If anyone makes more mistakes than I
do it must be the weather forecasters.
Thursday evening Loren Boatman said
he\[CloseCurlyQuote]d called off the snow. He didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t tell us
we'd have sleet and freezing rain in-
stead. I'd feel safer with the snow.

Sometimes I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve stated I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m for capital
punishment and other times that I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m not.
I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know if I is or I ain\[CloseCurlyQuote]t. Some parts
of it I sure don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t like. I think leaving a
prisoner on death row for ten years is
cruel and unusual punishment. More
than that I hate the hours of preparation
they go through just before their
execution. If it were my lot in life to be
executed I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d rather they\[CloseCurlyQuote]d do it in a
humane manner. Like inject something
into my body while I slept. Or if they\[CloseCurlyQuote]re

intent on using their gruesome electric
chair I think the victim should be
anesthetized ahead of time. And I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
think it should take them six minutes to
die. So now I guess I'm once again
against capital punishment. I know
prisons are over crowded, but the
decision on whether a man should live or
die should be left to our creator.
Methinks there's a lot of judges and
jurors playing God.

I think energy suppliers are
monopolies that should be broken up. It's
a sad state of affairs that we're forced to
use less energy so they'll have more to
charge higher prices for. They spend a
lot of money giving us tips on how to
conserve energy, then raise the price on
what we do use. If that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s fair I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know
the meaning of the word.

Ha Ha Ha, I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m beginning to be one of
the smart shoppers. I bought some
Christmas presents, and that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s early for
me.
\[OpenCurlyQuote]Unemployment figures may be down in
the state and nation, and maybe even the
county, but we still have a lot of unem-
ployed people in Findlay. I think the
Junior Woman\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Club and the Jaycees
are gonna need a heap of help this year to
see that every unfortunate family can
enjoy some kind of Christmas. Some of
us can help a little, and some can help a
lot. Let\[CloseCurlyQuote]s do it! !
