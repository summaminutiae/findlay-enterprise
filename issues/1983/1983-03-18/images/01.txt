District preschool screening program
will be held April 11 beginning at 9 a.m.

basement. All children who will be three
years old by Sept. 1, 1983, and all four and
five year old children will need to be
tested

Parents can schedule their children for
the screening program by calling Fin-
dlay Grade School, 756-8544, or by

r

coming to the grade school office.

Pre-kindergarten registration will be
held April 11 through April 15 for the 1983-
84 school year. A copy of the child\[CloseCurlyQuote]s birth
certificate should be presented when the
child is pre-registered.

Children can be pre-registered for
kindergarten on April 11 while the
preschool screening program is in
session.

The plan proposes that approximately
9 percent of Lake Shelbyville shorefront
be made available for purchase and
development. The full plan was detailed
in last week's Enterprise.

Thurber told the board that Durbin\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
commitment during the meeting in-
cluded the following items: \[OpenCurlyQuote]Verify the
\[OpenCurlyQuote]Udall Amendment\[CloseCurlyQuote] as it applies to Lake
Shelbyville and determine a consensus of
opinion regarding the application and
desirability of this amendement; obtain
a Corps of Engineers opinion regarding
environmental and economical impact
as they view it; investigate the pros and
cons of the subject as it applies to the
people of this county and the surrounding

plan for future action.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The plan does not in any way call for,
nor does it suggest that 100 percent of the
lake be made available for residential
and commerical development. No one
that is involved with the plan, including
the Findlay Village Board, will allow
restriction of public access to wildlife
sanctuaries or recreation facilities,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
Thurber said when making his report.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The plan does, however, provide a
situation that will allow the expansion of
Findlay as we know it today. Utility
services, school system taxation and
county taxation will allow Findlay to be a
more economical village in which to live,
as to creating a situation that
must be subsidized by the current
inhabitants,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he further related.

Thurber also stressed, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]the village
board of Findlay does not want to impose
any additional expense to any of its
residents and would welcome the
provision of additional residents, income
and jobs.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Both the Findlay Village Board and the
Shelby County board have given their
support for the proposed lake develop-
ment program, a plan presented by
Bohlen last week.
