FINDLAY ENTERPRISE

THE FINDLAY ENTERPRISE--FINDLAY, ILLINOIS 62534

Talk about a low down person. No one
could be lower than the one or ones who

Cemetery. They\[CloseCurlyQuote]re so low they could
crawl under a snake\[CloseCurlyQuote]s belly with plenty
of room to spare. They have no respect
for the dead or the living who spend a lot
of money for a stone for their loved ones.
I can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t imagine anything lower to which
any one could stoop.

There\[CloseCurlyQuote]s been some interest shown
lately in the number of twins in Findlay
Grade School. I wish I knew just how
many sets of twins there are in Findlay.
I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m sure we have more than a lot of
towns our size. I asked once why Findlay
had so many twins because I felt it was
unusual. The only answer I ever got was,
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s in the water.\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] Well I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m sure glad
Findlay water is good for something. As
far as I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m concerned there\[CloseCurlyQuote]s nothing
wrong with my water, but I do hear
occasional complaints about it. I guess I
like Findlay water. When I leave on
vacation I always wish I had some
Findlay water to drink.

I can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t believe all the millions of
dollars President Reagan wants to send
to El Salvador. I just don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t happen to
think they\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll appreciate it if we give it to
them. About every country we've helped
decides to hate us and hardly ever does
another country pay back loans we make
to them. Too often we've played Santa
Claus to other countries and been kicked
in the teeth for it. I think we have enough
economic and social problems at home.
If we ventured to take care of all of those,

Saturday was one busy day in Findlay.
I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know how much the

sale netted, but I do know there was a
whale of a crowd in town. Drivers had to
pick their way to get downtown, and it
wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t impossible to get tied up in a
traffic jam.

Sunday\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Donkey basketball game had
to be the funniest thing I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve ever seen.
The donkeys were so well trained that
amateur riders couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t match wits with
them. On Monday morning there were a
few of the Sunday riders who were
walking very gently. John Love might
have taken a prize for the most spills had
prizes been given. When I talked to him
Monday morning, he said he couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t tell
if his ankles, his rear end or his ribs hurt
the most. I told him maybe we could get
him a donkey and then he could be a
mounted policeman, and he said -- |
couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t stay on it.

It was a great afternoon of
entertainment and everyone had a great
time. They tell me the donkeys also play
softball. I'd like to have them back for
that sport and have the proceeds go to the
Little League or toward fixing the ball
diamond.

we wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have time to stick our noses _ fries,

into other countries\[CloseCurlyQuote]
probably keep a lot more teeth. Once we
shore up our own economic climate I
might be more willing to help our
neighbors, but if we don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t take care of our
problems no one will. I can just imagine
those other countries spending millions
of dollars on us if we needed help.

I love Greg Bohlen\[CloseCurlyQuote]s idea about
developing a part of Lake Shelbyville\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
shoreline. If he could swing the deal it
should help Findlay, their business and
schools a lot. I guess we built a lake at a
bad time. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s the first lake that was
under the Mo Udall rule that demanded
no development. Greg said the Corps of
Engineers didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t even want, to talk to
him. Well, that doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t surprise me. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve
found the Corps about as uncooperative
as can be in about every situation. Let\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
face it. The Corps could care less about
us and our problems. At least that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s the
way it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s been in the past. =

Cable survey

results revealed

Letter to the Editor:

Looking back at my letter, at the
question - Do we need a Cable T.V.
subscribers group to get results in
desired programming and etc.? Well, the
answer is NO (at this time.) Your no

is ano!

I have three answers as of now, all
three desired a Christian Channel, so no
action will be taken as a group. But what
we do have is three that will say to the
cable television company at the front
door, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I need a Christian 24 hour channel
on cable T.V. in an agreement, or I will
not be a subscriber at all.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

And you can do this at your front door
also. I urge loving prayers by all for all.

Jesus is Lord!
Thank you
