spring\[CloseCurlyQuote]s just around
the corner!

Most people don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think about insulating their
homes until cold weather arrives. But the same '
insulation that keeps the heat inside your home in
winter, works just as efficiently to keep the heat
outside in the summer.

lf your home is 10 or more years old, chances
are its insulation needs updating. By adding to
your insulation now, you'll avoid the rush next
winter and perhaps being placed on a long
waiting list.

The higher summer electric rates make
adequate insulation a more important investment
than ever.

Come by your nearest CIPS office for booklets
on insulation. We also can help you find a
qualified installer-dealer or provide you with
information on do-it-yourself techniques.
