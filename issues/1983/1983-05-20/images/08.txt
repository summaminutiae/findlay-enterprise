The Findlay High School Falcon baseball team has a 4-6 spring record. The
Falcons are scheduled to plan Shelbyville in the opening game of the Regional
Tournament. The Falcons squeaked out a 9-7 victory this first time they played

Spring of 1983 is still proving to be quite
an unusual year for farmers. The
weekend of May 6 and 7 was quite an

interesting weekend with heavy soil
losses occurring through wind erosion.

There was a lot of different ob-
servations on which fields were having
the worst wind erosion. From my general
observations the fields that \[OpenCurlyQuote]had been
moldboard plowed in the fall of 1982 and
had no tillage in the spring of 1983 were
producing the most soil wind erosion
problems. On top of this a lot of the soil
that had severe water erosion the past
weekend where the silt had accumulated
was also having severe wind erosion
problems

Along with the wind and soil erosion
problems farmers were faced with the
decision of replanting or not replanting
corn. Several factors enter into this
decision. Soil compaction was one of the
worst problems facing farmers with the
lighter timbered colored soils being
much miore compact than the heavier
prairie type soils.

This year the rotary hoe was sure
paying big dividends because several
people were using rotary hoes with ex-
ot te rane en ne
of the rotary hoeing the first ti idn\[CloseCurlyQuote]
look too favorable but a second trip
across the field along with some light
showers and warmer temperatures have
produced excellent results in getting a lot
of the corn to emerge around the county.

Farmers need to realize now that we
are past the middle of May that with
lower populations of around 18,000 plants
this will produce a yield similar to 22,000
population planted at this particular
time. So consider a lot of these factors
before deciding to replant corn or any
other crop.

Soybean Plots

This past week we were busy in the
Extension Service planting different
Soybean demonstrations around the

county. |

On May 10 we planted the soybean
variety plot on the Bohlen farm in Penn
Township. All together we had 76 dif-
ferent plots in the field. Fifteen com-
panies participted. These j
, Hoblit, Pickering, FS,
Uhoff, Kitchen Seed, Trisler, Gutwei
Americana, Pioneer, Asgrow,
Paymaster, McCurdy, Van Horn and
Voris. In addition to the private com-
panies the public varieties of Sprite,
Pella, Elf, Will, Fayette and Williams 82
were included.

On the Shelbyville Extension Vo. Ag.
demonstration plots we planted several
different soybean demonstrations this
past week. One of these included drilling
beans solid with a Marliss drill of three
different varieties. These included
Williams 82, Asgrow A3127, and Pella.
We seeded these
bushels, and three bushels per acre.

For the first year we have incl
some demonstrations on no-til] soybean
planting. This was done on corn stubble
ground that was no-till corn in 1982. We
used a Mariliss drill to seed some of these
no-till soybeans along wi
ternational Cyclo 30-inch row planter. We
have included several different herbicide
combinations for weed control.

We would like to extend our
preciation to Dowler Equipment Co.,
Massey Ferguson Equipment Co. and
Ingles and Otto Equipment Co. for

ap-

providing the equipment to plant these
no-till soybeans.

Extension Foundation .
The Shelby County Extension Foun-
dation met last week and are real

pleased with the progress being made to FINDLAY PERSONALS
County

date in support of the Shelby
Extension Foundation.

The primary purpose of the Shelby
County Extension Foundation is to
provide financial support for the
Cooperative Extension Service
programs in the county. The Cooperative
Extension Service program is the
educational arm of the University of
Illinois and through current budget
restrictions some programs are being
curtailed so the Extension Foundation
has been organized to provide additional
inanci Support to maintain the quality
of educational programs that have been
provided to Shelby County.

Wheat Diseases

With the current weather conditions
being very favorable for the develop-
ment of certain diseases in wheat far-
mers should be quite observant of wheat
fields this week.

The real critical stage for control of
most wheat diseases is when the flag leaf

county the flag leaf will probably emerge
in most fields this week. Farmers should
particularly be on the outlook for the
development of leaf rust and powdery
mildew. There\[CloseCurlyQuote]s also a possibility that
scab could start developing on wheat
plants.

Wheat seed producers should
especially be very observant of wheat
fields during the next two week period.

New Livestock Insecticides Approved
The insecticides Ectrin ten percent

Ectiban 5.7 percent immulsible con-
centrate have received approval for
direct application to certain types of
livestock for certain insect pests.

We foresee Ectrin and Ectiban as most
welcomed additions to the group of in-
Secticides available for livestock

Both of these insecticides as
direct sprays on cattle are expected to
provide more effective contro] of flies

Lema Pogue and Ruby Banks had
lunch at the Meeting House Sunday.

fit the bill?

See me about the policy
that pays 100% of the
first $2,000 of hospital
expenses and 80% of all
other covered medical
expenses. And unlike
many other policies,
there is no maximum
limit to the amount the
policy will pay. For more
information, call today.
