when electricity was less
expensive to generate, our
customers paid the same
\[OpenCurlyQuote]tate for their electric
service all year around.

As more and more
customers installed air
conditioning, the demand
for energy grew steadily.
To meet this increased
demand, our generators
must be ready with a
maximum supply, or
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]peak load\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] of electricity
from June through
september, the air
conditioning months.

The purpose of the higher
summer rates is to reflect
the higher costs
associated with the
summer peaking season.

Why should those

who don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have air
conditioning have to
pay the higher
summer rates?

The summer rates aren't
designed as a penalty, nor
do they represent an
additional benefit to CIPS.
Our rates must signal the
way in which our costs
actually occur. Because
the summer peak demand
is greater than the winter
peak demand, we have to

less energy you'll use for
the unit\[CloseCurlyQuote]s operation. Ask
