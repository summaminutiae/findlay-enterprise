Me THINKS iy paiine sine

The potential closing of Eagle Creek
State Park isn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t making the Findlay
community happy. I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t see why it
should be closed. After all the state has
invested a lot of money to put it there.
The essentials like roads, water and
electricity are there, so why close it now.
It seems that they don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t want to afford
the upkeep of the park.

Well, I hate to see even one person in
this area lose a job. There\[CloseCurlyQuote]s so much
unemployment around here that we can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
afford anymore. My feeling is that
probably Findlay benefits more from the
Eagle Creek State Park than some of the
others. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s closer than most of them, and
for campers there Findlay is the closest
place to shop. None of the parks have
caused us to have a booming business of
any kind, but I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m sure that the grocery
store, restaurant, Findlay Freeze and
the gas stations do get some trade from
them. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s closing would not help our
economy, and we need something to
build it up. Nothing more to tear it down.
If the state\[CloseCurlyQuote]s losing money on Eagle
Creek maybe they\[CloseCurlyQuote]d like to rid them-
selves of the responsibility and give it to
us. Fat chance!

In Tuesday\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Herald and Review a
paragraph in a story about the possible
park closing said, \[OpenCurlyQuote]He (Charles Tam-
minga, director of the Conservation
Department) said the public will still
have access to the parks and can still
picnic, fish, launch boats or do other
activities which do not require the
presence of park personnel.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] The next
paragraph says, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But all movable
equipment will be taken out, and roads
leading to the campgrounds will be
closed.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Movable material must mean
picnic tables, picnic shelters, toilets and
a few other things -- so much for the
picnicking. And most roads in the park
do lead to camping areas.

Evidently fishing will be limited by
access to only a certain road or two. As
for leaving the boat ramp open, I hope
they also find it in their hearts to leave us
access to the parking lot. I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think the
Governor\[CloseCurlyQuote]s left hand knows what his
right hand is doing. Just a short time ago
they built a nice office building at the
park. Mike Tate says he thinks the park\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
closing can be averted. Let\[CloseCurlyQuote]s hope so.

There are a lot of people who stand to
lose much if the park is closed. What
about the ones who bought a bait shop on
the road to the park. Will they be losers
too? I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m sure that most of those fish at
Eagle Creek also camp there. Closing the
park may be a big deal for the governor.
Well, it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a big deal for us too, but in a
different way.

This column has been a hassle for me
this week. I have the flu bug, and when
I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m ill I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think so well. When I have a
fever, I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think right at all. I hate
being sick, but I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m taking good care of
myself and hoping for an immediate
recovery. I spend my days taking
meédications and either filling or laying
by the vaporizer, and I sleep a lot. Then I
make a lot of trips to the thermostat. One
minute I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m too warm and the next
minute I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m freezing. I know that ther-
mostat has never been changed so often
in the 30 some years it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s been there.
Enough about the illness, I know I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m not
the only one who\[CloseCurlyQuote]s caught the flu bug
lately. So many of you have had it that
you already know all about it, and I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll bet
you're just like me -- just sick and tired
of being sick and tired. Here\[CloseCurlyQuote]s hoping the

' bug dies out soon so none of us will have

it. Larry Rodman called Monday mor-
ning, and I told him \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I feel awful.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He
said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]Do you want me to make you feel
worse?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] That\[CloseCurlyQuote]s when he told me about
Eagle Creek, and for sure I felt worse.
Maybe I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll be more capable of doing this
job next week -- right now I gotta go find
the couch, some cover and the vaporizer.

Cable television

viewing discussed

Letter to the Editor:

I am for and like Cable T.V. But, Cable
T.V. service and good programming is
not all automatic in a city! Good up to
date (state of the art) cable T.V.
equipment and good maintenance will
get you good service, and good
programming (to you) is what you like
and enjoy.

We do the paying, why can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t we do the
saying (IN PART or ALL) about
programming we will be viewing on
cable. Programming doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t add to the
cost of the system at all.

As a subscriber group to Cable T.V. we
can make a big difference providing
programming ideas for enjoyable

viewing by all by having a programming
agreement before or at the time the cable
system is installed in the home.

We know what we want and like. I am
not paying for cable service to turn it off
and not be used. How about you? A group
can

$400 to $400 in capital asset value te the
cable company. (That is Big Money! ).

Send me the programming you need on
cable to be a subscriber of cable T.V. at
all! Send me other desired programming
too (list in order of interest). Some
available Cable Satellite Networks and
stations are (some 24 hours) Christian,
Childrens, News, Sports, Movie, Big City
Stations and on and on.

Now as to the cost of the cable service,
as the paper says it, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What the traffic
will bear.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] What can I say. It looks like

- the city doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t care as long as it gets the

three percent, but it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s all out of our
pockets, and what will be the cost of
installing cable to homes at start of
service, $25 to $100? And what will the
cost of a second and third T.V. set be? As
a group we can have a say in this too.

Send your list of ideas and program-
ming NOW! All it costs is a 20 cent
stamp. Yes, I live in Findlay.

I have two questions!

1. Do we need a subscriber group, or
would you like to see a group to produce

2. If we don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t stand up to this need,
WHO WILL?

As for now I will list, (in order of in-
terest), the desired programming you
want in the paper. Get your likes on this

list; send me your programming interest
now!

A NOTE to Christians, now is the time
to stand up for a (24 hour) Christian
channel. Check with the spirit of God that
lives within you. Yes, your body is a
temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you.
We are therefore Christ\[CloseCurlyQuote]s ambassadors.
Faith without action is dead!

I urge and request loving prayers
without anger or disputing be made for
everyone of those in Findlay in authority,
the cable company, those in Findlay and
me. Jesus is Lord!

Fan compliments
teams conduct

the Findlay Falcons and their coaches! !
From a spectators point of view this was
the most enjoyable pair of teams that
I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve ever seen. A well balanced, team-

usually kept their cool when we
fans were losing ours.

having a cool night someone else was
having a hot one.

A special round of applause is due to
some of the guys who spent a lot of time
on the bench due to the close games. I
have a special respect to you. Your stick-
to-it-attitude and your willingness to put
out if even for a few seconds says a lot for
your character.

cane gaenes Ki we had used cur snergy
more to encourage our players than to
discredit the referees? I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m afraid that
Findlay fans are getting a bad name
among the other schools and that surely
does our teams no credit. The
cheerleaders and Tim Clark as the
Falcon did a great job in trying to lead
us; we just didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t follow.
Winning to me seems to be a thing of
character not of final scores and these
were two of the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]winningest\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] teams I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve
ever seen. Great job, guys! !
