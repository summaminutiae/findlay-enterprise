nights the facility is not in use. Hash told
the board that he felt the amount charged
for use of the gym would not cover the
cost of heat and lights.

Ron McClain addressed the board in
references to the high school ball
diamond. He asked the school board for

approval to light the field, put up a five
foot permanent fence and fix the back
stop and dugouts.

McClain said that a total of 22 new
lights would be purchased and that Mike
Summey of Central Illinois Public
Service Co. was looking for some poles to
use in the project. The school board
agreed to check on insurance and
provide insurance coverage if possible.

an equalization aid grant totalling $254.82
and a per capita grant totalling $438.10.

Established in 1977, the per capita
grant program provides additional
funding to local libraries levying a local

funds. Edgar said that the amount of
grant money awarded this year has
increased by approximately 2% cents

libraries levying a local tax of .13 cents
or more.
