Auxiliary unit
seeks to fill
blood quota

Mrs. Wheeler says she doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think
that it is well known in the Findlay
community, but there are 16 veterans at

Memorial Home and 17 at the
Manor. Most of the veterans came from
the Danville Veterans Hospital. She is
sure they would appreciate visits from
other veterans in this community.

\[OpenCurlyQuote]Just take a pack or two of cigarettes,
go down and get around a table and
spend an hour with them. Some of the
veterans are from states far away and
have no relatives close enough to come
visit them,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] she said. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It would mean so
much to them to know that there are
people who do care.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Members of the Findlay American
Legion Auxiliary Unit will be calling for
donations of blood when the American
Red Cross bloodmobile visits Findlay
Tuesday, March 8. The bloodmobile will
be located at the First Christian Church
from 1 to5:45 p.m.

Findlay has a 70 unit quota to meet at
this annual visit. Everyone who is over 17
years old and in good health can donate

The actual blood donation takes about

Wheeler said. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be manufactured
and as the old saying goes, you can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t get
blood from a turnip. It comes only from
human beings who care enough about
other human beings to recycle part of
their lives.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
