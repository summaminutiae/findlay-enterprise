It looks like most Shelby County voters
approved a tax increase when they voted
to elect rather than appoint a supervisor

supervisor would cost us money but you
can bet it will. A letter from R. Dale
Young, deputy director of the Illinois
Department of Revenue to Carl
Buesking, a county board member, cited
Ill. Rev. Stat., Chap. 120, Par. 484b,
which provides for reimbursement by
the state for 50 percent of the salary of an
appointed supervisor of assessments.
The state is not authorized or required to
reimburse 50 percent of the salary of an
elected supervisor of assessments.

In a letter to Supervisor of
Assessments Linda Cook from Robert F.
Jones, Vermillion County treasurer, he
said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]As Vermillion County treasurer I
Have not received any reimbursement
from the State of Illinois for any portion
of the supervisor of assessments salary
since our elected supervisor of

was installed in office.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The
provision for the State of Illinois reim-
bursement of portions of the Supervisor
of assessments salary applies only to
eer ere by the county

So it looks like we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll have to come up
with more tax monies. I was surprised
the people of Shelby County voted this
added tax on themselves and wonder if
all of them knew what they were doing?

There was good and bad news at the
Wesleyan football game Saturday af-
ternoon. The good news was the Titans
won. The bad news was I nearly froze to
death. When the game was over my feet
