FmHA special actions
taken to help farmers --

Special actions by Farmers Home
Administration (FmHA) to help farmers
stay in business were up substantially in
the 1983 fiscal year, FmHA State
Director Robert W. Chambers said last
week.

In FY 1982, Chambers said, this type of
help totaled 748. In fiscal 1963, which
ended Sept. 30, similar actions were
1,909. |

The specifics:

In the 1982 fiscal year, the number of
Farmers Home farm borrowers who had
their loans rescheduled or reamortized to
help them in making payments was 287.
In 1983 that was up to 1,324.

In addition, Chambers said, Farmers
Home in Illinois assisted another 58
borrowers to obtain additional credit
from the private sector. These

Home subordinates part of its loan
collateral to other lenders, totaled

States.
