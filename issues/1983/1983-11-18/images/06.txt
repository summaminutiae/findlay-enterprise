Hypothermia risks increased
when thermostats decreased

a dangerous drop in their internal body
tures

degrees Fahrenheit can _ trigger
hypothermia. However, a drop in in-
ternal temperature also can occur
rapidly if a person falls into icy water or
is exposed to freezing weather without

proper clothing.

A drop in internal body temperature
can happen to anyone, but the elderly are
more at risk. One reason older men and

women are particularly susceptible to
hypothermia is that their bodies often do
not adjust to changes in temperature as
quickly as they used to. They may not be
aware they are gradually getting colder.

A person is especially vulnerable if he
or she is sick or unable to move around
well, or does not shiver or react to cold

normally.

When body temperature drops below 94
or 9 degrees, the blood vessels near the
surface of the body narrow to reduce
heat loss. Muscles begin to tighten to

make heat. If the body continues to cool,
shivering will start and continue until the
temperature drops to about 90 degrees F\[CloseCurlyQuote].
Then it gets into the danger area. If the
body temperature drops below 90, a life-
threatening situation exists.

There are several signs that can aid in
identifying possible victims, but not even
a doctor can tell exactly how vulnerable
a person might be. Hypothermia can
deprive people of judgment and
reasoning power because the cold affects
the brain. Signs to look for are forget-
fulness, drowsiness, slurred speech, and
a change in appearance, such as a puffy
face. A victim will have a weak pulse, a
slow heartbeat and very slow, shallow
breathing. Coma is probable if the body
temperature drops to or below 9%

degrees.

If you should notice these symptoms in
another person, take their temperature.
If it is 95 degrees or below, call a doctor
or ambulance, or take the victim directly
to a hospital. Try to prevent further heat
loss by wrapping the victim in a warm
blanket -- preferably thermal or elec-
tric. You can also use hot water bottles or
electric heating pads on the stomach --
but never on a high setting.

Do not give a hypothermia victim a hot
shower or bath; it could cause sudden
shock. If the victim is alert, give him
small quantities of warm food or drink
but nothing alcoholic. Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t try to treat
hypothermia at home. The condition
should be treated in a hospital.
