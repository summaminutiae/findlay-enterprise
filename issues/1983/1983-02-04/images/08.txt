When I was only four,

by Charley Halleck

When I was four I fell on the floor.
Since I am ten I fell on a hen.
Now I am twenty I wish I had money.
by Caryl Yantis

When I was one I thought I was dumb.
When I was two I tied my shoe.
When I was three I hit a tree.
When I was four I wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t for sure.
When I was five I was a Jive.
When I was six I was a fix.
When I was seven I thought I was eleven.
When I was eight I had no bait.
When I was nine I was a spine.
I am ten my sister is a big fat hen.

There was an old lady from Spain
Who never went out in the rain.
One day she got wet and caught a cold
net and she never came out again.
