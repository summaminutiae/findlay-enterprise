Rainfall picks up

After two weeks of very hot, very dry
weather, there was recorded
precipitation in Shelby County. During
the week of Aug. 19 to 25 the high was 1.2
inches recorded in Penn Township and
the low was .1 recorded in Clarksburg,
Prairie and Sigel Townships.

In the northern end of the county,
Todd\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Point Township received .40 in-
ches of precipitation; Okaw Township
received .5 and .5; Ridge Township
received .5 and .45; Pickaway received .6
and .5 and Penn received 1.2 and .66.

CHAMPAIGN--Fall precipitation
Should be near or above normal in
Illinois, a State Water Survey offical
says.

The precipitation outlook for Sep-
tember through November indicates the
greatest likelihood is for near-normal
amounts in the northern three-fourths of
the state, said Stanley A. Changnon Jr.,
chief of the survey.
