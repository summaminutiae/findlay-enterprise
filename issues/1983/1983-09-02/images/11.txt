The Findlay Falcons dropped their
first two games of the 1983 fall baseball
season this week. At Findlay on Monday,
Aug. 29, the Falcons fell to Windsor by a
score of 7-4 and on Wednesday, Aug. 31
Neoga edged Findlay 4-2.

In the Windsor game the Blue Devils
broke open a 4-4 contest with three runs
in the seventh inning to hand the Falcons
their opening game defeat. The Falcons
managed only four hits in the game in-
cluding a home run by Joe Lucas and hits
by Norman Willer, Michael Kneirim and
Mike Kellow.

Findlay played well against Neoga but
were unable to take advantage of some

key scoring opportunities. Brian Herzog
and Tim Rothrock each had two hits and

Joe Lucas and Norman Willer had one
each to lead the Findlay hitting attack.
Michael Kneirim was the starting pit-
cher for the Falcons. Croy was the
winning pitcher for Neoga.

The Falcons will see action Friday,
Sept. 2 when they entertain the
Teutopolis Wooden Shoes and again on
Friday, Sept. 9 as they go to Stewardson-
Strasburg. Both games are scheduled for
4 p.m. A complete fall baseball schedule
for the Falcons and Findlay Junior High
Tigers will be in next week\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Enterprise.
