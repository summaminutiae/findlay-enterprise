Storm damage

A. AA

A huge tree limb fell on a home owned
of a severe thunderstorm. Part of the limb fell on Mohr\[CloseCurlyQuote]s roof, damaging some of
the guttering on the home. The severe storm that hit Saturday evening dropped
over two inches of rain on rain parched Findlay. Other storm damage including
several tree limbs down was also reported.

school

For the first time in five years, in-
cumbents will face opposition for their
seats on the Findlay Community Unit
school board.

Two Findlay school board candidates
are practically assured of election, but
the other five candidates -- including two
incumbents -- will battle for two seats.

Running unopposed in their
congressional township are incumbent
Duane Uphoff and Ben Dawdy. They are
in congressional township 12 North
Range 4E.

The fact that school board candidates
in unit districts are candidates from
congressional townships and that no
more than three persons from a single
congressional township may serve on the
board makes for complex filings.

Five candidates including incumbent
board president Herb Bricker Sr. and
incumbent board member Rob Winings
are from township 13 North Range 4E.
Other candidates from this area are
Lonnie Francisco, Jack Howell and Jim
Saddoris.

Since there is already one board
member, Jack Getz, serving on the board
from this congressional township, only

board

two of the five candidates will be elected.
Getz is not up for re-election.

Unit superintendent Ron Hash says he
checked the situation out with Shelby
County Clerk Dwight Campbell. The
Findlay school district encompasses six
congressional townships.

However, only four of the townships
are populated. There is no possibility of
candidates filing from the other two
townships -- they lie in the middle of
Lake Shelbyville.

The school board election will take
place in November in conjunction with
the general election. Incumbents have

A severe thunderstorm struck Findlay

A bolt of lightning hit the Carl Brown

released at Shelby County Memorial
Hospital.

Carl was adjusting the television. He
was knocked down as a result of the
lightning jolt.

Carl reported that the force of the bolt
blew all of the electrical cords out of the
Brown appliances. It also tripped the
main fuse, circuit breakers and all of the
individual breakers.

In addition, the bolt of li
damaged the outside siding behind the
guttering on his home, leaving holes in
two places. The lightning also blew the
cover off the telephone junction box and

Carl said in \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]we feel very
