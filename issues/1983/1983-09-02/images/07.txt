THE FINDLAY

Around the county

thing we are
concerned with is not so much as the leaf
feeding but the feeding on the soybean
pods. With a lot of the soybean leaves
starting to dry up and turn colors the
bean leaf beetle likes to feed on the
greenest thing on the plant and that will
be the soybean pod in the near future.

Several insecticides are available and
will provide good control of the bean leaf
beetle including Sevin, Lorsban, Cygon,
Penncap-N, Pydrin and Lannate.

We would caution soybean producers
to watch their fields very closely for
potential damage caused by bean leaf
beetles feeding on soybean pods between
now and soybean maturity.

Health Management

Several Shelby County cattle
producers have already begun working
on a health management program for
their feeder calves which will be con-
signed to the EILA health management
cooperative sale on Oct. 28.

All cattle consigned to this sale must be
treated under the certified health
management program. All local
veterinarians have details of the

by sale date. Calves will be tagged in the
right ear by special tag and the numbers
recorded on the certification form.
Calves must be weaned prior to Sept. 30
and acclimated to grain and drinking
from a water tank.

Calves must be vaccinated IBR-PI-3,
BVD, two injections of Pasteurella sp.,
two injections of H. somnus bacterin,
Black-leg malignant-edema, and wor-
med. Cattle must also be treated for lice.

The certified health management
program has been very successful in the
past and data continues to improve each
year. It provides beef cattle producers
the excellent opportunity to market their
cattle.

Several beef producers have also taken
advantage of this opportunity to handle
the cattle and have them weighed and
enrolled in the Illinois Beef Performance
Testing program.

If you would like additional in-
formation on the health management
and cooperative feeder cattle sale or the
Illinois Beef Performance Testing
program contact the Shelby County
Cooperative Extension Office.

Alfalfa Harvest Date

The date of the last alfalfa harvest is
important if the crop is to survive the
winter and produce a vigorous first crop
next year.

The last harvest date is causing some
management problems for producers
this year because of the drought stress
that has been placed on the alfalfa crop.

Alfalfa has its energy storage in the
roots and crowns. A high level of energy,
stored as starch and small amounts of

fertilizations are encouraged if the
alfalfa did not receive adequate fer-
tilization during the past growing season.
Alfalfa removes about twelve pounds of
phosphorus and 50 to 55 pounds of
potassium for each ton of dry matter
removed.

What Can I Afford to Pay For
An Acre of Drought-Stressed Corn?

The livestock producers faced with
shortage of feed and drought damaged
corn are questioning the value of the crop
as silage.

Animal nutritionists report that ac-
cording to experimental feeding trials on
growing beef cattle, the feeding value of
severely drought-lamaged corn har-
vested as silage is about 75 percent that
of normal corn silage. Thus, as a feed
crop, what can be salvaged could be
worth more as silage than as grain.

total vegetative growth.

A farmer can calculate the value of
normal corn silage. Price of a bushel of
corn times six plus cost of ensiling a ton
of corn silage. Example would be $3.50
per bushel times 6 plus $6.00 for har-
vesting would equal a cost of $27.00 per
ton. Assume an 80 percent value of the
drought-stricken silage would be 8
percent of 27 or $21.00 per ton value.

The lower value of stress corn appears
to be in reduced tonage per acre and
increased harvest cost. Be sure to adjust
for dry matter content of the silage, cost
to transport the wet silage and other
costs to harvest.
