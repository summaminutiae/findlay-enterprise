Theatre production, didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t go as
smoothly as the first. Dress rehearsals
were cut back because the musical\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
star, Colleen Zenk, had to fulfil taping
committments to CBS in New York on
Monday.

That meant the difference between the
smooth performance that the opening
night audience was treated to in \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Dames
At Sea\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and a performance (especially
in the second act) that was marred by
several errors -- some glaring and some
not so obvious.

The production will probably be
tightened up considerably in the next day
or so by director Bill Haens. Hopefully he
will find places to shorten the musical --
it was a very long two hour and 45 minute
production Tuesday night.

One of the highlights of the produc-
tions, and a real treat compared to other
musicals, was the orchestra. Instead of
just the bare minimum of instruments,
musical director David Fehr branched
out and had several different in-
struments and two electronic keyboards
to add to the range of music. Co-producer
Tom Marks takes credit for arranging
one of the more unique instruments to
make an appearance at a Little Theatre
production, a harp. The harp adds a
touch of class to the performance.

If I had any beef at all with the music,
it would be with the key. A lot of the
music was written so low that at times
Colleen was impossible to hear. That\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
the key the original production on
Broadway was written in and that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s the
key that the producers have used in the
Little Theatre production.

The low key was just about Colleen\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
only problem. Considering her schedule
of the past few days, she did a fantastic
job in the lead role of Sonia, the energy
charged, eccentric lyricis.

The part of Sonia calls for a certain
quality, call it kookiness. I say Sonia is
an original \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]space cadet.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Colleen plays
the part to the hilt. She loves Neil
Simon\[CloseCurlyQuote]s dialogue and is able to master
the intricacies of her part.

Her fiancee, Michael Crouch, and her

it took lots of planning -- and
streamlining -- by set designer George
Wilson and production stage manager
Ann Folke.

Special note should be mace of two of
the main pieces of scenery (props):
Vernon\[CloseCurlyQuote]s piano and his sports car.
Rather than use the actual thing, which
would have proved a little bulky both on
Stage and back stage at the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]little\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

constructed. The car especially delighted
the audience.

Another technical problem was han-
dled quite hilariously by technical
director Jeffrey Horvath. How do you
depict a car ride on a stationary stage?

Sullivan, the little pianos are scheduled
for engagements across the country.

sorry for her. Snappy dialogue makes
