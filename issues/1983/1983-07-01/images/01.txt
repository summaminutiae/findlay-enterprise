Volunteers needed: new books added

Several new books were cataloged and
covered at the last meeting of the Fin-
diay Public Library Board on June 16. In
addition to helping prepare the books for
circulation, the board discussed several
items of business.

Several new volunteers are needed at
the Findlay Public Library. The list of
available volunteers has dwindled over
the past year. Any member of the library
board can be contacted if there is an
interest in volunteering at the library.

Most volunteers assist at the library
for about two hours a week helping to
check out books and help is also needed
to catalog new books and return books to
the shelves. Anyone with any amount of
time to donate is encouraged to contact a
board member.

The Findlay Public Library is operated
completely by volunteer help. There is no
paid librarian and the members of the
library board are not paid for their
services. The library operates on tax
receipts of approximately $3,000 plus
revenue sharing funds provided by the
Findlay Village Board.

In other business, the board talked
about the new summer reading program,
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Reading Rainbows.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The program
started June 22 with several youngsters
in two age groups participating. The
program will continue through the last
week in July.

This is the first time in several years

invited to participate. The program

Church members honor minister
for 30 years of service in Findlay

Members of the First Christian Church
of Findlay held a special celebration
Sunday to honor their minister Lyle R.
Jesse. Rev. Jesse marked 30 years as
minister of the Findlay church and
members planned the celebration to
mark the occasion.

Rev. Jesse was first surprised by a
duet by his two sons, Mike and Nathan.
Then, when he began to preach, Jeff
Browning, who is minister of the
Grayville Christian Church came down
the aisle and preached.

In the evening, a second celebration

- was held marking the occasion. Ice

cream and cake were served to a total of
78 people. The cake was beautifully
decorated with a replica of the First
Christian Church.

Rev. Jesse and his wife, Juanita, were
presented with a microwave oven from
members of the congregation during the
evening celebration.

Following the presentation, Rev. Jesse
showed slides of happenings and ac-
tivities of the church and church
members taken when he first came to
Findlay. He will show slides again next
Sunday night, July 3 and the public is
invited to see these old slides.
