Me Thinks 1, rain Briney

The big summer holiday is almost
here, and the key word for the holiday is
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]CAREFULLY.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

If there are fireworks to shoot -- shoot

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Where outihishinir bia shine
agenda -- do it carefully.

If you\[CloseCurlyQuote]re driving -- drive carefully.
Have a happy holiday and enjoy it

The life you save is precious to
someone. Maybe you.

Just five years ago I spent a lot of my
summer watching little league baseball,
and the boys, Barry, Brett and Bart
Robinson, showing cattle at fairs. My
how I enjoyed it. But kids grow up all too
soon, No more showing at fairs, no more
little league games for them. One is
married and will become a father in
September, making me a_ great-
grandmother. One has graduated from
high school and the youngest one will
enter high school this year.

Now Barry\[CloseCurlyQuote]s taking care of his own
cattle, Brett\[CloseCurlyQuote]s staying with the Martins
in Springfield and playing on the
Springfield American baseball
team, and I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m sure Bart\[CloseCurlyQuote]s dreading the
time that school starts again. He got that
part honest. His mother and DeeAnn
Winings hated school more than anyone I
ever knew.

Darby Martin is playing baseball this
summer, and Karly is on a soccer team,
but I can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t get to Springfield to watch
Brett, Darby or Karly play very often. It
was much easier when I only had to go to
Bethany. Maybe I'll be lucky and get to
watch my great-grandchildren play ball
at Bethany, if I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m able. I supposed that
by the time I attended my oldest grand-
child\[CloseCurlyQuote]s wedding I'd be in a wheelchair or
hobbling on a cane, but I would have
made it fine if I hadn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t fallen off my
bicycle just before the wedding. At first I

I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve been griping my head off because
electricity users have to pay for work in
progress at plants the power companies
are building, then I read in Sunday\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
H&R that we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll also have to pay for
demolishing the plants after their life
span. That\[CloseCurlyQuote]s just one more thing we ain\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
never gonna git done paying for.

interested in paying higher taxes just to
help them, but I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m just as sure that I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll
pay them if they are assessed. I wish
somebody in Springfield would dream up
a formula for downstate taxes and
another one for Chicago. Small towns
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have a chance. I wanna see that we
are getting something for added taxes,
and I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t ever go to Chicago.

Have a happy holiday and enjoy it
CAREFULLY.
