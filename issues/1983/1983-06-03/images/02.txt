I was in the Illinois State
building Thursday for the first time
I was in the eighth grade. Back then I
thought it was beautiful. This time I was
surprised at how cluttered it was. It must

Capitol
since

Eagle
Creek did better than a lot of others that
were kept open.

But I soon learned it was not up to us to
question, but no very good answers were
forthcoming. Probably it was a political
issue, and the Department of Con-
servation was under orders to cut
spending for one reason and that reason
was to help get the governor\[CloseCurlyQuote]s tax
package passed. The first person to
speak to us was the Governor\[CloseCurlyQuote]s aide, and
he explained right off the bat that all
government supported departments
would be hurting unless the package
passed and more money was for-
thcoming. I believe that to be true. I do
question why the state was in such good
shape financially the day before election.
That makes it difficult to believe that
overnight something happened to put it
in dire circumstances. Either it was not
as good as the candidate for re-election
said it was, or it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s not in as deep trouble
now as he would have us believe. I even
think it was a political boondoggle to
have the park close at 3 p.m. on a holiday
when the parks have the most campers.
But who am I to question the country
boy?

There\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a beautiful, well used park out
there that won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be helped by shutting it
down for even one month. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m afraid the
undesirables and vandals will find a
hiding place there, and that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a shame.
There are millions of dollars invested in
that park. I tried to convince them that
they could well lose more money than
they could save by closing it for a month,
and one of the DOC men said he wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
argue that point. In fact he agreed with
that possibility. They did say one positive
thing. They said the first of the nine
closed parks to be opened would be Eagle
Creek and gave us hope that it could well

be open by July 1.

I think Findlay had a very impressive
Memorial Day Parade as usual. Traffic
has to be stopped for a while while the
parade marches to the cemetery, and
you wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t believe how many vehicles
are backed up in both directions. That
makes it evident that there\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a heck of a
lot of traffic through here on holidays and
most weekends.

I talked to Lynn Williams at Eagle
Creek State Park Monday morning, and
he said the park was full all weekend,
and they were turning people away up
until early Monday morning.

I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve been told by the

There still a good possibility we might
get a factory to move to our town. Cross
your fingers and hope it happens. We
should be able to divulge more details in
the near future.
