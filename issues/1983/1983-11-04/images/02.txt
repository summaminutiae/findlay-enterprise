M eThinks by Pauine Briney

I feel a little better about the situation
in Bierut and Grenada but not much. The
President's

soaped my windows did a good job, but I
appreciate the fact that they soaped one
side one night and the other side the next
night. That way I didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t i eet done
scrubbing to do. Soaping is not
bad kids, just kids having fun. I never did
soap any, but that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s because my mom
had other things for us to do during the
Halloween season. Like she wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t let
us out of the house except one night. That
night we could go trick or treating but
only to the homes of our closest neigh-
bors, and I have a feeling she had an
eagle eye on us all the while.

Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t forget the Christian Church
bazaar. They have some mighty pretty

browse and buy in the time in between.
The old village hall is empty, and now
the community club board can start its
project -- a new community center for

project is to be grant funded. I called
Sheriff Bob Collins, and he said it was not
to be grant funded. He also said that at a
recent Bar Association meeting in
Chicago it was said that if the Depart-
ment of Corrections would remove some
of their restrictions on jails there
wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t need to be so many new
facilities to prevent overcrowding.

I have not been to any prisons, but I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve
heard from some who have visited them
that some of the facilities look like
country clubs and have that kind of an
atmosphere. There\[CloseCurlyQuote]s no reason for me to
believe that a prison\[CloseCurlyQuote]s main function is to
offer luxuries to prisoners. If it was more
uncomfortable for them they might be
less anxious to commit crimes that send
them there, they might not like to go

time.
