interested in the way our school is run
and the quality of education our children
are given.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]

In defining the roles of administrators
and the senool board, Francisco said,
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Administrators run the school on a day
to day basis by the guidelines set down at
board meetings

and

financial considerations made it

necessary.

On the question of cuts, if financially
necessary, Saddoris said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It is my hope
that we could at least maintain current
levels, and if that is not possible I think
we would have to study the situation long

what to cut. I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t feel at this time I
