There was a very scary witch seen
around the halls of Findlay Grade
School last Friday. No one knew who
the witch was. It almost looked like the
witch was going to take off on her
broom at the Halloween parade!

Board candidates state views

Polls will be open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Tuesday for Findlay voters to participate
in school elections and two questions of
public policy.

For the first time in five years, there is
opposition for two seats on the Findlay
School Board. Five candidates have
squared off for two seats on the board,
and two school board candidates are
practically assured of election.

Running unopposed in their
congressional township are incumbent
Duane Uphoff and Ben Dawdy. They
reside in Congressional Township 12
North Range 4E. :

Because of state law, no more than
three persons from a_ single
congressional township may serve on the
school board. This makes the election

are from Township 13 North Range 4E.
Other candidates from this area are
Lonnie Francisco, Jack Howell and Jim
Saddoris.

Since there is already one board
member, Jack Getz, serving on the
school board from this congressional

township, only two of the five candidates
can be elected. Getz\[CloseCurlyQuote] seat is not up for re-
election.

The Findlay school district covers six
congressional townships (two are in the
middle of Lake Shelbyville). Three in-
cumbents, Bricker, Uphoff and Winings,
decided to seek re-election. The fourth
board member, Forest \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Frosty\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Herron,
will retire from the board.

QUESTIONNAIRES CONCERNING
the school district and the candidate\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
views on several issues were filled out by
the seven school board candidates.

The candidates responses to the
questionnaires are:

Herb Bricker Sr.

Incumbent board president Bricker,
44, has served on the Findlay School
Board for seven years. He has been a
farmer for 26 years and is a graduate of
Findlay High School. He has been past
master of the Findlay Masonic Lodge, a
member and vice president of the Shelby
Country Club, Farm Bureau member,
past Jaycee member and is a charter
member of the Findlay Lion\[CloseCurlyQuote]sClub. _

Bricker has one son in the Findlay
schools. Rodney is a fourth grader. Two
of his children are recent graduates;
Herb Jr. was graduated in 1979 and Jody

in 1981.

On the question of major issues facing
the school board, Bricker states,
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Finances are the major factor now and
later, decisions concerning cuts, etc.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

When asked what specific skills he
would bring to the school board, Bricker
pointed out, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]with seven years ex-
perience I have learned a lot about the
many problems and factors concerning
State aid, financing and legal matters
which confront board members . . . which
you only learn from experience.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]

When asked to define the separation of
roles between the board and ad-
ministrative staff, these were Bricker\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
views: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Plainly, you have to face all
problems with an open mind and not
show preference to any certain one
person, pertaining to making (a) fair
decision.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

When asked about cutting programs if
financial considerations make it
necessary, Bricker said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You would
have to study the problem and start
cutting where it would jeopardize the
least amount of students, probably arts,
sports, music, etc., keeping in mind what
I said in jeopardizing the least.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Bricker stated, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I am seeking re-
election because of having seven years
experience which I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m sure will be

beneficial in the next three or four
critical years ahead on decision making
ahead. I have learned from being a board
member, you have to work at it like a job
to be of great value. I face all financial
matters from a taypayers standpoint
first and with an open mind.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Bricker rated the Findlay schools
superior. He has attended all but one
school board meeting during the past
year.

Ben Dawdy

Seeking his first term on the school
board, Dawdy, 44, is a computer systems
analyst with Caterpillar Tractor Co. He

Protection District. He is also a volun-
teer fireman and emergency medical
