Federal regulations require
changes in medical bills

Under prior regulations, radiology (x-
ray) and pathology (laboratory ) services
plus cardiac interpretations (EKG)
tests) fees for inpatients at hospitals
were paid at 100 percent. The distribution
of charges between Medicare Part A and
Part B was handled by the in-
termediaries and individual patients
were not personally im: >lved.

Shelby Memorial Hospital has
established a department to provide
billing services for the various
professional services formerly included
in a patient\[CloseCurlyQuote]s bill. The new service.
operating as Shelby Memoria!
Professional Group, will issue bills and
collect for specialists\[CloseCurlyQuote] services which, by
the new regulations must be kept
Separate. Under prior methods, when a
patient in the hospital had an x-ray or a
lab test, the bill for this service came
from the hospital who, in turn, paid the
physician specialist. Now, the hospital
bills only for the technical service and
the Professional Group will bill for the
professional service.

According to Garland Strohl, Shelby
Memorial Hospital Administrator, the
total bill will be no greater than before
except Medicare patients must now pay

20 percent of the physician\[CloseCurlyQuote]s professional
fee, which increases their personal ex-
pense unless their private insurance
provides this coverage. Strohl stated this
is only being consistent with earlier
progams since x-ray and lab tests per-
formed for outpatients previously had a
20 percent co-insurance provision.

Problems will develop, Strohl added,
because patients now will receive an
additional bill for a physician \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]they
never saw\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] but who provided services
for them and in their behalf. The new

regulations will probably cause an in-

crease in insurance premiums for most

Todd's Point home extension
enjoys Springfield trip

Members of the Todd\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Point Home
Extension Unit enjoyed a trip to
Springfield Tuesday, Oct. 25. The trip
included a tour of the Illinois Governor's
mansion, lunch and shopping at White
Oaks Mall.

The trip began with a visit to the
Illinois Governor\[CloseCurlyQuote]s mansion in
Springfield. The mansion has been
restored in recent years to its original
State. The mansion is furnished with
many fine antiques as well as a few
newer pieces.

Extension members were most im-
pressed with one of the antiques, a
harpsichord dated in the mid-1800's. On
the musical instrument was a sheet of
music from the same period entitled,
