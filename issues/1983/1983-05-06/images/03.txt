The Findlay Grade School fifth grade
class, Mr. and Mrs. Ryan, Bill Walters
and Christie Herzog enjoyed a field trip
to Lincoln Log Cabin State park near
Charleston. |

When we first got there the fellers did
chores while the gals cooked our vittles.

The fellers did chores which were
sawing wood, working in the garden,

Fifth graders travel back in time

planting taters and cleaning out the barn.

Also the gals worked in the garden too. -

For our vittles we had boiled taters,
apple crisp and johnnie cakes.

Both the fellers and the gals made
candles too.

After we ate our vittles we played a few
games, then we started home and
everyone enjoyed our field trip to Lincoln
Log Cabin State Park.

Professional storyteller Loralee Cooley
of Atlanta, Ga. was in Findlay

Charlotte Newman
to head CF drive

Charlotte Newman of Findlay has been
appointed to lead the 1983 Cystic Fibrosis
fund raising event May 7 at the Findlay
Grade School. The rain date will be May
14.

Further information may be obtained
by contacting Mrs. Newman.

and will be for the next 12 consecutive months.

The purpose of this plan is to allow Village
natural gas customers to average their bills over a 12
month period rather than paying for actual monthly
usage. All customers will still pay the same amount
for a 12 month period, however budget billing will
allow customers to avoid the very large bills
associated with the winter months by averaging their

usage throughout the year.

Details of the plan and sign-ups will be taken at
the Village Hall during normal business -hours.
Customers in the plan last year also need to sign-up

again.

The sign-up dates will be May 9th through the

28th, 1983.
