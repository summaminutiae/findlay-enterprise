MeThinks by Pauline Briney

The Findlay High School gym was the
scene of a lot of comedy and toe-tapping,
hand-clapping country music Saturday
night when and country
people gathered for the annual variety
show

I was amazed at the professional sound
of the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Destiny\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] band. And along with
the tricks pulled on the audience which

the Findlay community and the
willingness of the people to donate their
talents. I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t happen to have anything
to offer to a variety show, and if I did I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d
be scared out of my wits to be on stage
with an audience.

I parked behind some other cars, so I
had to be the first one to leave. I hope I
didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t miss much of the show. I started
out once and turned around when I heard
a roar of squeals and laughter. When I
looked back I saw Charlotte Newman,
Chris Tippit and Jane Herron grab Ron
Hash, Forest Herron and Rick Beem out
of the audience and dance away with
them on the gym floor to the stage music.

I wish I could tell you who missed the
show all about it, but that would take a lot
of time and a lot of paper. Go see it for
yourselves next year. You don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know
what you\[CloseCurlyQuote]re missing. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve always heard
that everyone has a special talent. Well
I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve spent almost 58 years looking for
mine, and if I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t find it soon I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll be too
old to enjoy it or show it off.

Some light poles have been donated
and some used lights offered cheap so I
wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be surprised to see some night
softball games starting before long.
There\[CloseCurlyQuote]s also been a lot of volunteers
offering to help rejuvenate the diamond.
Louie Williams has donated a house
trailer to be used for a snack shack, and
as I understand it, the Jaycettes will
operate it. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m glad for the addition of a
snack shack. Not that I need the extra
calories, but I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d rather have some
popcorn or a hot dog while I watch a
ballgame.

I had a call from Congressman Durbin
last week and was to return his call. I
really wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t terribly anxious to call
because of my comments about him in a
Methinks column. Well, I finally did call
him, and he was very gracious about the
whole thing. My chief complaint to him
was that Lake Shelbyville was supposed
to have been a boon to us, and it was
more of boondoggle. I told him that so far
the lake had been an albatross around

our necks. He agreed it wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t meant to
be that way and it shouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be that way.
He promised me that he and I would
meet with the Corps of Engineers and see
what could be done. He said he has some
ideas in mind that would be helpful, and
some of us have some too. So here\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
hoping something good will happen.

I was impressed with the vote counter
at Shelbyvilie Thursday morning when
the votes were recounted. It took the
machine less than two minutes to count
200 votes. I can remember staying up all
night counting votes, getting to a stage
where my mind was almost blank and I
wondered if I knew what I was doing. If
you\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve been an election judge I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m sure
you know the feeling. I remember a few

age. If it starts taking jobs away from
people, I won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be so fond of it.

I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m not anxious to have anymore
nights weatherwise like Sunday night.
Brett Robinson and I left Springfield and
headed home about 9 p.m. All we saw
most of the way was a lot of lightning
lighting the sky from every direction. We
ran across some little pond on the road
along the way, but on Route 128 we ran
into lake after lake. When we got on the
Findlay road the lakes turned into what
looked more like an ocean. I was happy
when we finally got through that one, and
we made it just in time. Right after we
made it through they closed the road.
I've never seen that much flooding
around here before and don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t care if |
ever do again. Rain\[CloseCurlyQuote]s okay, but it doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
need to come all at once.

Happy Mother\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Day.

Dear Pauline: ar --
You probably remember me,
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you. I really enjoyed your
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Methinks\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] column in the March 25
issue. You tell it like it is. When I was a
small child, my grandpa kept his bottle
hid in the barn. Grandma had one for

medicinal

Then Dad had one in the barn, Mom
kept one for medicinal purposes. --

If we were lucky enough to be ill, we
would get a teaspoon in hot water with
plenty of sugar. Itcured anything. _

Shelbyville was the closest but Sullivan
also had a bar and back doors to slip in
and out. .

While there, they bought the bargains
that big groceries offered.

Then back to Findlay to hide and enjoy
their spirits.

I now live in Arkansas. My husband
Travis taught me years ago that
everything could be enjoyed, if not
overdone

My Jim Beam, my wine and my beer is
open for all to see and enjoy. I use my
common sense that God gave me and I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m
not afraid to voice it.

There is no hidden closet or back shed
to hide mine in.

I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t want to hide it. I think if
everyone is up front, you'll find the truth.
Half of those who voted against the liquor
law are buying it elsewhere.

This county in Arkansas is also dry, but
we make our own or dive 17 miles away
to Thayer, Mo.

Thank you for listening to me.

Heavy rains in recent days have kept
farmers out of the fields and created
lakes where none usually exist. Children
