In Memory of my Mother
Betty Lorraine Rohl
on Mother\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Day
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Letter\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] by Doris Hoose
The letter lay, fragile and stained,
on top of the pile. It was hard going
through my mother\[CloseCurlyQuote]s things,
Missing her was still so new, I looked

at the date. It had been written by a |

friend to my mother in 1939, shortly
after my father died. ,

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Dear One\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote], it began, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote] it hurts so
terribly, doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t it? Accept the pain
if you can. Say, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote] Yes, because I
have loved and now lost, I must cry
for a while. I must hold this ache of
loneliness within myself and Say,
this is the price I pay for having
loved. I will accept this price and
pay it in gratitude for the love I was
blessed to know, for I would not have
wanted to be without that love, I will
pay this price, God, and I thank you
for the wornderful years we
shared.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

\[OpenCurlyQuote]I think He must have cried on
the day that His son hung dead on
the cross, don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you think so? Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
you think that because He too is
familiar with tears, dear friend, He
is especially close to you right now?

I weep with you, and my love
surrounds you. Please write and let
me know your plans and if there is
anything at all I can do to help.

I folded the letter and slipped it
back into the envelope, grateful for
this healing message from the past.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Thank you for the wonderful
years, Mom \[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I whispered. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote] Of all
the women in the world, I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m so lucky
YOU were the one God gave me, yes,
it WAS WORTH THE PRICE.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Remembering you with love,

< Your daughter Gloria
