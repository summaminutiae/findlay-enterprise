A mother requested that I use this
article. She said that with all the new
Christmas toys around, especially
during the Christmas vacation

something that might still be useful to

moms. |

The article written bf Linda Metzke is
entitled \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]Lists and Love\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and first asks
the question, \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]What\[CloseCurlyQuote]s most important . .
. a Clean, organized house or carefree
happy children? And she describes how
one young mother found the answer to
this question.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]HAVE I ALWAYS been so
disorganized, or has it just been since
my children have taken over my heart
and home? But I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve learned -- and will
never forget -- that a disorganized house
is a lot better than an unhappy child.

\[OpenCurlyQuote]My lesson began when an old friend
explained how she got everything done
-- her laundry washed, folded and put
away on the same day; her refrigerator
and oven cleaned every other week; the
kitchen floor free of crumbs, trucks and
doll clothes; and other near miraculous
feats of housekeeping. AND .. . she
sewed, read, made crafts and looked
great all the time. She made a list of six
things she was going to do each day --
and she did them. How simple!

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]T began. I got my laundry washed,
folded and put away on the same day -- a
first in four years! My kitchen cup-
boards, refrigerator and stove were done
the next day! I was amazed at the
sparkling appearance of my home. . .
but the sparkle in my child\[CloseCurlyQuote]s eyes was
dimming. So I began to put things like
\[OpenCurlyQuote]play with Michelle\[CloseCurlyQuote] or \[OpenCurlyQuote]play in sandbox\[CloseCurlyQuote]
on the list. But I began to realize that I
was beginning to yell at my children
because I was afraid they would mess up
the \[OpenCurlyQuote]clean house.\[CloseCurlyQuote] ;

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]After two weeks, I was a
was organized and productive but also
crabby and impatient. The list didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
give me time to play trucks, make messy
cookies, or wonder at the sound of
shuffling through the leaves, or look at
books, or sit and rock. The list outlined

each day so that surprises and in-
_ terruptions weren\[CloseCurlyQuote]t welcome.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]My house and life\[OpenCurlyQuote]are mine again! I
threw away the lists! My floors are
littered with toys, my table is*dotted with
fingerpaint, the living room is scattered
with kid\[CloseCurlyQuote]s messes -- and four little eyes

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Love and laughter -- and the
memory of washing, folding and putting
the clothes away in one day -- are all I
need. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s time for the unexpected -- and

the delightful! Clothes and lists? They
can wait another day. But two year olds
and four year olds will quickly flit

away.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t understand difference in
depression and recession. it is
this nation is now expe is being

called a recession, but to me it sound
more like a depression. I looked up

by
increasing unemployment, falling
prices, etc.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Well, we have the decline in
business and increasing unemployment,
but we sure don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have falling prices.
That makes it all the worse. It would be
easier to cope with the first two if we did
have falling prices. Well, I decided
according to Webster, we don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t quite
have a true depression, so I decided to
see what he had to say about a recession.
A recession is \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]An economic setback in
commercial and industrial activity,

especially
turn during a period of generally rising
prosperity. Well, we ain\[CloseCurlyQuote]t got that either.
I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t see any signs of rising prosperity,
not even in a downward turn. Prosperity
for most of us went down the drain with
the severe decline in business and rising
unemployment that are a part of the
depression, and with the .aflation that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
never before been known to be a part of a
depression. So I guess neither definition
describes our plight. Maybe we're in a
decession or a repression or whatever.
Anyway most of us don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t like the
economic conditions of this country right
now. They keep telling us it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s getting
better, but I can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t see the improvement.
We still have village leashing laws but
some of the dogs don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know it, and their
owners don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t care. Some people say we
need to let dogs run loose, and most
people have a fit if the canines are
allowed to roam around town. We can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
please \[CloseCurlyQuote]em all anyway, but they should
be willing to obey the law.
