A LAYER OF TEARS

A layer of tears is the only
barrier between your eyes and
contact lenses. And it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s not
because you\[CloseCurlyQuote]re crying. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s just
the natural moisture of the eye
doing what nature intended:

thin, moist layer of tears in
position over the cornea (or
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]window\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]) of the eye. The tears
supply oxygen to the corneal
tissue. Every time you blink, a
fresh supply of tears flows

Today\[CloseCurlyQuote]s contact lenses are
made of a very thin, light plastic
that creates hardly any pressure
at all. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]feather-light\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] lens
that knows its place.

Contact lenses have to be

your eyes. And the prescription
for vision correction has to be ac-
curate to give your eyes the help
they need.

tact lenses should be checked
regularly by your eye specialist
to make sure they\[CloseCurlyQuote]re as com-
fortable and as effective as they
should be.

In the interest of better vision
