Findlay stays wet

_ A discovery recount on the wet-dry
issue Thursday produced no change in
the vote.

One township was recounted in the
discovery and the vote total stands liquor
was approved by four votes. The recount
took 45 minutes.

The recount was requested by Lyle
Jesse and said he would accept the
results and not pursue the matter any

further.

Questions about the polling places
arose because the polling was done in two
places. Under the consolidation of
elections law, all elections whether they
be school board, village or general will
be held in the same polling places.

There are also questions about the
distance between a church or school and
places that want to sell liquor. According

to state law there must be 100 feet bet-
ween a church or school and a place
selling alcohol. The 100 feet does not
apply to places such as a restaurant or a
food store if alcohol is not the primary
item being sold. Also, when the
measurement is taken, the 100 feet ap-
plies from the nearest part of the
building where services are being held --
not from the property line.

Money problems plague school

Money problems continue to plague the
Findlay school district. Unit Supt. Ron
Hash Wednesday told the board that if
some tax receipts are not received in
June, the district will have to issue an-
ticipation warrants. |

But that is merely a cash flow problem
of relatively short duration.
larger are cuts in both state and federal
spending on local schools.

Even the 1980 census is impacting the
school district. According to the 1970
census, there are 42 economically
disadvantaged students in the district.
According to the 1980 census, this figure
has dropped to 27, and this means that
the district will lose from $4,500 to $6,000
\[OpenCurlyQuote]In federal aid. Hash said that there is a

hold harmless clause in the legislation so
the school district should get 85 percent
of planned spending this year.

General state aid is estimated to
decline $1,100 next year, and only 63
percent of the money spent on special
education will be reimbursed by the state
of Illinois. The district received $553 this
year for gifted students but will get only
$287

In an attempt to save money in the
operating fund, the school district is
going to a single source supplier for
janitorial supplies. The administration
has selected Western Chemical and will
rely on the firms representatives to
maintain inventories and instruct the
custodial staff in how chemicals and

other supplies are to be used for
maximum effectiveness.

The board agreed to pay for 21 tons of
white rock that had been delivered to the
School grounds on order of a township
official. The rock was used under
playground equipment and at bus
unloading areas. The board paid $443.10
to G.W. Prosser for the rock.

Louie Coleman asked the school board
to pass a resolution for seniors down to T-
ball players to have priority on the ball
diamond and all events of any type to be
cleared through Lonnie Francisco,
not aware of the organization of the

Findlay Recreational
Joe Lucas has resigned as janitor.

Judges view
library for
State award

Judges for the Governor\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Home Town
Awards Program were in Findlay
Wednesday to view the library.

The village had submitted the library
project for consideration for the Home
Town Award.

The village is one of 93 towns statewide
and is one of 13 villages with a population
of between 100 and 900 under con-
sideration for the award. The awards will
be made May 18 and 19 in Springfield.
Winners will receive plaques, and first
place winners will be eligible for a grand
prize traveling cup.

Various civic and student groups held
fund raisers to establish the library
which is housed in a room at the grade
school. The library has more than 1,900
volumes and is staffed by volunteers.

The judges will base their decision on
how well the project met local needs, how
the community was kept aware and
active, what specifically was ac-
complished and if and how the town is

continuing its efforts. The program is
designed to recognize and encourage

- volunteer efforts in the local level.
