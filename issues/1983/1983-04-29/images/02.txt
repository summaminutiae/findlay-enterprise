it was held at the village hall and the
Todd\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Point Township shed. Someone
evidently thinks all votes should have
been cast at the village hall. As I un-
derstand it, all elections will now be held
at the two places, including the school
board election that was formerly held at
the high school. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve also heard that as
the vote stands now Todd\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Point is dry
and Okaw Township is wet. This was not
a township vote. It was a village vote,
and only villagers could vote. However
the recount turns out, the village of
Findlay will be either wet or dry. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve
also heard that no business place wants
to sell liquor is far enough away from a
church. I guess whoever comes up with
this is more intelligent than our attorney,
but we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll take all of our advice from him.

It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s been a dusty year for the town with
the sewer project under construction. I
hope now that it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s over we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll find a way to
get rid of some dust. was
complaining about the grocery store
being dusty, and I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m sure it is -- even an
hour after it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s dusted. That\[CloseCurlyQuote]s the way my
house is. Sometimes Sid has to keep one
of the two doors locked to keep the dust
from coming in even more. I sympathize
with him and hope the situation can be
remedied.

I can hardly wait for work to start on
the Arches building. I love that building
and would like to keep it for future

I hope I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t eat these words, but I

think spring has sprung, and I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m en-
joying every minute of the nice weather
we're having. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m sure the farmers

appreciate it too. When I went to Bethany
Monday I saw a lot of work being done in
the fields.

I haven't heard anymore about the use
of the village hall after the village moves
its offices to the old fire house. I do hope
its use will benefit the in
some way. It would be ideal for a com-
munity center because there are no
steps, and it would accommodate wheel
chairs also. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve been told that some
senior citizens can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t go to Findlay Club
meetings and dinners because they can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
negotiate the steps. If we would all be
willing to contribute work or money, the
seniors could fix it up to fit their needs
and pay operation costs such as utilities.
The utilities shouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be too costly
because the building wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be used
every day.

I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m glad the Caterpillar Tractor
Company and the union have settled
their differences and gone back to work.
I know it will help the workers and also
the community.

If the state doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t keep its promise
about some in our area of
Lake Shelbyville, then they should be
willing to let a private developer do it.

_ ternoon at the Baptist

Recreational League at a meeting held
several weeks ago. A notice of that
meeting was advertised in this paper.

The article about the way I questioned
the way village employee salaries were
being divided, if the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]reporter\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] would
have done any research she would have
found that my accusations were

exactly
accurate. The [Illinois Commerce
Commission does require a full time
employee for
our

the gas department, but
are on call 24 hours for all
departments. The Village board requires
this regardless of the Illinois Commerce
Commission.

I would like to suggest to the editor of
this paper, that he would send a reporter
that is unbias, and able to report fully all

the facts concerning any Village Board
Meeting.

Thank you
