Tired Eyes

If you\[CloseCurlyQuote]re experiencing tired
eyes when you read for a long
time or while doing close work on
the job, you may need reading
glasses

This happens to a lot of people
as they approach middle-age or
pass the 40-year mark. If the
problem is in your focusing
muscles, that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s natural
As most people get older, their
focusing muscles get weaker.
They have trouble reading.

When you\[CloseCurlyQuote]re dining out, do you
have difficulty reading the
menu? Or do you feel eye strain
when reading a newspaper or
magazine? Does any printed
matter have to be held farther
away from your eyes than nor-

mal? Do you have to squint to
read the fine print?

It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s not worth the eye strain or
headaches to put off getting
glasses or contact lenses, if your
eyes need help. Whether you're
on the job or at home, you want to
be able to see and read in comfort
without strain.

An eye examination is the only
way you can be sure your eyes
are getting all the help they need.
