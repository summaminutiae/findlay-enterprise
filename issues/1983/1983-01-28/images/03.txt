Cable television discussed

Cable television and a proposed
agreement with First Rural Cable, Inc.
of Decatur was discussed by the Findlay
Village Board at a special meeting Jan.
17.

Village attorney E.C. \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Chris\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]
that an initial

village cable television franchise and
would resubmit it to First Rural\[CloseCurlyQuote]s at-
torney. The two attorneys will work out
the However, the franchise
will not be signed without the consent of
the village board.

A representative of First Rural Cable,
Dale Scheruman, talked to the board
about a master antenna transmitting by
microwaves to smaller towns if the
government will lift regulations against
it.

Scheruman reported that with the
proper franchise agreement, the com-
pany can have cable television in
operation by November. They would like
to install Findlay\[CloseCurlyQuote]s system at the same
time as Bethany and residents of the
Elam Lake area. If a contract were
signed, it would read that installation
would be made in Findlay within a year.

The system would be set up with 40
channels, no less than 12 to start. There
would be no cable television office in
Findlay, but customers of the system
would be able to call collect to the
Decatur office.

The First Rural representative also
told the board that most of the cable for
the system would be installed un
derground, and they would have pole
agreements for any poles they needed.
He said that there were fewer problems
with a system when it is put in the
ground. Any damage done to alleys when
trunk lines were installed would be

repaired.

The village would have no input into
rates. However, the village could charge
a fee for the service, and cost would be
passed on to the customer. Rates are
currently $10.50 for the basic service, $9
for Home Box Office and $9 for Cinemax.
These rates aren\[CloseCurlyQuote]t firm and will increase
June 1. Programming is at the
descretion of the company.

The cost of installing a cable television
system is expensive. Scheruman said
that the cost is $10,000 per mile to install

cable.

The board discussed several problems
with the new sewer system.
These included completing sewer

and

a partial payment to one contractor,
Kieffer Brothers Construction.

The board approved a motion to pay
Kieffer $20,000 toward his final payment.
The remainder of the money will be paid
from grant monies after the project is
given final approval by the En-
vironmental Protection Agency.

.The board also discussed an
agreement and signed a contract with
Central Illinois Public Service Co. for
street lights. The village is currently
paying $202.83 for 70 street lights. The

rate was increased by almost $70 to .

$271.20.

A request was made to the board by
Jack Yantis for an exclusive garbage
hauling contract. Yantis asked the board
if present garbage companies have a
contract with the village.

He asked if the board would put out on
bid a contract to pick up garbage in the
community and limit all garbage
hauling companies to one. Yantis would
like to have the garbage service and said
he could do it as cheaply or cheaper than
present companies. Rates for garbage
service would be fixed for one or two

year periods. :
The board will take Yantis\[CloseCurlyQuote] proposal
under consideration.
