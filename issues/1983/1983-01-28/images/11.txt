How to keep your home
warmer and use less
energy this winter

Insulate your home thoroughly.

You'll greatly reduce energy waste. You'll require
(and pay for) less energy because the heat will stay
inside your home where it belongs.

Thorough insulation means: Weatherstripping
around windows and doors; wrapping ducts and
pipes with insulation; insulating ceilings, outside
walls and floors over unheated areas; and caulking
around doors and windows and small openings that
allow heat to escape from your home.

We'll be happy to answer
your questions about insulation.
We have booklets on insulation
and energy efficiency. Come by
your nearest CIPS office for
your copies--soon.
