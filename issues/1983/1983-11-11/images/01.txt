This was the first school board election

any opposition for seats on the board.

IN ADDITION TO electing school
board members, Findlay area voters
also made their choices on two public
policy questions.

The first question was whether or not
the supervisor of assessment post should
be elected or appointed. The question on
the ballot was, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Shall the Office of
Supervisor of Assessments of the County
of Shelby be elective rather than ap-
pointive?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]

Findlay area voters went the same
direction as the rest of Shelby County,
