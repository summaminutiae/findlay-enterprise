Those who have worked diligently on
planning a Community Center no longer
wish to be referred to as \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Com-
munity Center Board.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Just the Com-
munity Center volunteers. So far most of
the people who have attended the
meetings have been those on the board,
and they are afraid other residents of the

you can do to help. 0.K.?

As far as I know the next meeting of the
Findlay Village Board will be held in its
new home just west of the former village
hall. It may not be yet, but
we'll probably be able to meet there.

I keep hearing the question, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]When
will we have Cable TV.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Well, I guess
your guess is as good as mine. I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
know. We should be hearing more from
First Rural TV soon, and as far as I know
they\[CloseCurlyQuote]re the only ones who have the an-
swers.

I thought we had a safe and sane
Halloween. Didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you? More treating
than tricking and a minimum of van-
dalism. That\[CloseCurlyQuote]s great compared to some
of the Halloweens we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve had in the past. I
remember when a lot of damaging tricks
were pulled all in the name of Halloween.
I think I won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t name them. We\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve got a
good bunch of kids, and I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t want to
give them any wild ideas.

The Christian Church basement
resembled a variety store Saturday
morning. I had to babysit Saturday so I
just ran in to get a picture and back out,
but they sure did have a lot of things to
sell. I was told they\[CloseCurlyQuote]d worked all year
getting ready for the bazaar, so I hope
they did well.

This column is a little difficult to write
this week. I spent all of last week and
part of this week covering a murder trial
in Shelbyville. The other things I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m
thinking right now may not be too in-
teresting -- like I wonder if this nice
weather will hold out one more week so I
can go to Bloomington to a football
game? Surely they won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t end up a trial on
Saturday and prevent me from going to
the game. As I write this Sunday mor-
ning I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m wondering who will be elected to
the school board, whether we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll elect or
appoint a supervisor of assessments, and
will we or won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t we vote to build a new
Shelby County jail? Then I'm trying to

remind myself each day I MUST NOT
FORGET TO VOTE.

If they vote to build a new jail, I\[CloseCurlyQuote]llthen

wonder where the money is coming from.
If need be I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t mind paying more
taxes for education, but that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s about it.
I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m not interested in making a jail more
comfy cozy if it costs me any money. For
the most part those who inhabit jails as
prisoners had a choice whether to take up
residence there or not, and it was their
decision. They should have been aware of
the conditions before they decided to
commit a crime. I think jails should be
adequate for the health and safety of the
prisoners, but they don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t need to be
plush.

There\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a question I want to know more
about in the future. I want to know how
much it cost Shelby County taxpayers for
the murder trial recently tried in Shelby
County. It must cost a lot more to have a
prosecutor besides the state\[CloseCurlyQuote]s attorney
try the case. Then I wonder also, \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]Do we
have to pay for the many, many
prosecution witnesses who are brought
here from Decatur, Springfield,
Washington D.C. and many other
places.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll bet it costs a bunch. Will that
amount be added to our tax bills? I asked
someone last week, \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]Who\[CloseCurlyQuote]s paying for all
of this?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and that person said, \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You and
I are as taxpayers.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I hope not, but I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll
bet he\[CloseCurlyQuote]s right. I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t want any added
taxes unless the money taken in is to help
me and other residents of the county. But
the charges always say People vs
Somebody. I suppose we are the people
so it will no doubt cost us somewhere
down the line.

Letters to the Editor...

U.S. Marines pay
price of freedom

Dear Editor,

My husband and I graduated from
Findlay High School and we sometimes
have the opportunity to read the Findlay

. I read with interest the
METHINKS column and the article on
the views of people in Findlay on the
Lebanon issue in the Oct. 28, 1983 En-
terprise.

Where was the outrage of the
American people when the first Marine
was killed in Lebanon? Was not his life as
precious as the 230 Marines killed in the
bombing? As a reporter wrote in
Newsweek/Nov. 7, 1983...\[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]The men who
died last week died in the service of their
country; nowhere is it written that a man
is a greater hero because he died while
killing someone else.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]

Our son is a U.S. Marine and proud of
it. He was not drafted; he alone made the
decision to enlist. He wanted to serve his
country; he knew the risks involved.

It is easy for us to say \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Bring the
Marines home\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] for we live in freedom.

and its government and not get thrown
into jail or worse? Freedom is not free;
we pay a price. a:

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The day will come when my body will
lie upon a white sheet neatly tucked

brain has ceased to function and that, for
all intents and purposes, my life has

stopped.

\[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]When that happens, do not attempt to
instill artificial life into my body by the
use of a machine. And don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t call this my
deathbed. Let it be called the Bed of Life,
and let my body be taken from it to help
others lead fuller lives.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Give my sight to the man who has
never seen a sunrise, a baby\[CloseCurlyQuote]s face or
love in the eyes of a woman. Give my
heart to a person whose own heart has
caused nothing but endless days of pain.
Give my blood to the teen-ager who was
pulled from the wreckage of his car, so
that he might live to see his grand-
children play. Give my kidneys to one
who depends on a machine to exist from
week to week. Take my bones, every
muscle, every fiber and nerve in my
body and find a way to make a crippled
child walk.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Explore every corner of my brain.
Take my cells, if necessary, and let them
grow so that, someday, a speechless boy
will shout at the crack of a bat and a deaf
girl will hear the sound of rain against
her window. Burn what is left of me and
scatter the ashes to the winds to help the
flowers grow.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]If you must bury something, let it be
my faults, my weaknesses and all
prejudice against my fellow man. Give
my sins to the devil. Give my soul to God.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Tf, by chance, you wish to remember
me, do it with a kind deed or word to
someone who needs you. If you do all I
have asked, I will live forever.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] --Robert
