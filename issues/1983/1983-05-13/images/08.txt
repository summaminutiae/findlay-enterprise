of thanks

Thank you for the card shower and
birthday gifts.

Edna Hendricks

Perhaps you sent a lovely card,

or sat quietly in a chair,
you sent a floral spray,

if so we saw it there.

Perhaps you spoke the kindest
words,
As any friend could say;
Perhaps you were not there at all,
Just thought of us that day,
Whatever you did to console our
hearts

We thank you so much for your part.
Family of Thelma Ames
