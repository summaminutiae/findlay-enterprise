As a result of near record rains, the

Sewer systems appeared to be
~, Overloaded and several basements and
y ' yards were underwater. Many blamed
\[OpenCurlyQuote]= the new sanitary sewer system for their
| problems, claiming that in the past the
water drained away better.

As a result of the new sanitary
system, the old sewer lines were turned
into a storm sewer. However, rainwater
was getting into the new sewer system
and many persons faced problems with
sewage backed up into their homes.
Sewer commissioner Ron McClain told
village engineer Lee Sierkerka that
something would have to be done with
inflowing surface water into the new
Sanitary sewer system to prevent
problems which occurred last week from

happening again.

Sierkerka defended the new system,
Saying it worked under normal con-
ditions. The nearly five inches of rain
experienced by Findlay last week was
not normal.

Several sources of incoming surface
water into the new system were
discussed, including the drainage
problem at the high school, water getting
into the system through manhole covers,

and sump pumps.

Most residents in Findlay with
basements have sump pumps installed
that automatically kick on when it rains.
Utility supervisor Bill Rankin told the
board that when a resident had a
basement with a washer or shower they
were told the sump pumps should drain
into the sanitary sewer system. All other
Sump pumps were to drain into the yard.

Liquor ordinance passed

Enterprise Editor
Findlay mayor Pauline Briney broke a
tie vote to adopt a liquor ordinance
Monday at a meeting of the village
board.

Trustees Dwight Riley, Dave Thurber
and George Carter voted against the
proposed ordinance. Voting for the or-
dinance were Larry Rodman, Ron
McClain and Chuck Farris.

The ordinance provides for six licenses
to be issued within the corporate limits of
the village of Findlay. One Class A
license for package liquor sales: two
Class B licenses for beer and wine sales

licenses. Prospective license holders wil]
fill out the applications and the liquor

commissioner, Mrs. Briney, will issue

the licenses.

This was the reason that Riley said he
voted against the ordinance. Riley ob-
jects to having only one person control
the liquor licenses. He would like to see a
three member panel; however, Riley is
not interested in being a member of such

a panel. Riley is also opposed to Sunday --

The only reason that Thurber gave for
voting against the ordinance was that 50
percent of the voters turned down the
liquor referendum. Carter declined to
