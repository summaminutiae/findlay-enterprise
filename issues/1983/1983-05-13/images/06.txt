CIPS customers to receive
adjustment on fuel bills

Electric customers of Central Illinois
Public Service Co. will receive an $18
million benefit as a result of a recent
legal settlement between Consolidation
Coal Co. and the utility, according to
Donald G. Raymer, CIPS president.

The
$18 million benefit will be reflected in the
fuel adjustment charges on bills of
electric customers beginning in June.
The FAC is used by utilities to reflect
increases or decreases in the cost of fuel
used to generate electricity.

The ining proceeds from the

CIPS proposed that the adjustment in
customer bills be made on a monthly
basis so all customers are treated fairly,
according to Raymer. He noted that
sirice customer usages vary by season,
the monthly adjustment will assure that
customers share equitably in the set-
tlement.

CIPS and Consol reached an
agreement on March 31 to settle a
dispute that began in 1976 over the
quantity and quality of coal Consol was
delivering from its Hillsboro mine to the
utility\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Coffeen station.

The settlement also resulted in the
termination of the contract between
CIPS and Consol under which coal was
supplied from the Hillsboro mine. Coal
for Coffeen station will be supplied in the
future from the Monterey Mine at
Carlinville.
