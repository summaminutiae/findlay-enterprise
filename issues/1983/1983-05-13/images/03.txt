the board that 100 feet was interpreted to
be 100 feet from the wall of the building to
the wall of the business that sells the
liquor. Not the property line.

VILLAGE OF FINDLAY
NATURAL GAS BUDGET
BILLING PLAN

The Village of Findlay is again offering a Budget
Billing Plan to all natural gas customers. This plan will
start with the natural gas bills mailed in June, 1983,
and will be for the next 12 consecutive months.

The purpose of this plan is to allow Village
natural gas customers to average their bills over a 12
month period rather than paying for actual monthly
usage. All customers will still pay the same amount
for a 12 month period, however budget billing will
allow customers to avoid the very large bills
associated with the winter months by averaging their
usage throughout the year.

Details of the plan and sign-ups will be taken at

the Village Hall during normal business hours.
Customers in the plan last year also need to sign-up

again.

The sign-up dates will be May 9th through the

28th, 1983.

Dave Thurber, Gas Commissioner
