If you\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve been by the Bank of Findlay
lately you already know they\[CloseCurlyQuote]re on their

spirit, and we\[CloseCurlyQuote]re in need of more of that
right now.

In fact I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m hoping community spirit
will help get the ball diamond fixed and

some lights out there so the men can play
night games. If you have some extra
cash you\[CloseCurlyQuote]d like to use to help that project,
send it to Rod McClain, -
treasurer of the Findlay Athletic

Me TRINKS y race sine

Association. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve been told that
Clarksburg has a really nice ball
diamond. Well, if they can support it why
can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t we? It seems a lot of machinery
and labor has been offered so what they
need mostly now is cash.

We now have two restaurants under
new management. Roberta Heiland is
proprietor of the Meeting House Cafe,
formerly the Tastee Freez, and Junior
and Ione Stewman have taken over what
was formerly Findlay\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Finest
Restaurant and have renamed it J.R.\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
Place. And, if all goes well, we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll soon
have a supper club in the corner of the
Arches building. I can hardly wait. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m
thrilled to see even one less empty
building in the downtown area. I wish we
could find a way to fill them all up. I just
like boom towns better than ghost towns,
and we refuse to let Findlay be a ghost
town, don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t we?

Methinks isn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t thinking well this week
for some reason. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve been told, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]When
you don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have anything to say it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s time

to shut up, and that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s what I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m doing for:

this week.
