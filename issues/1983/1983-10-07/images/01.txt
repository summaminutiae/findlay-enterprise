It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s finally done.

Over ten years have passed since the
Findlay Village Board first tackled a
proposed upgrading of sewer facilities.
Since that time, the board has employed
two engineering firms and spent nearly
$2,000,000.

The new sewer system and sewage
treatment plant are complete and fully
operational. On Oct. 1, a final inspection
of the last phase of the sewer project was
conducted. The plant was accepted by
both the engineering firm and the village
board representatives.

The rest is history!

The first study on waste treatment was
prepared in 1973 by Clark, Dietz and
Associates-Engineers, Inc. of Urbana.

That study, Cost/Effective Evaluation of it was being put under a sewer ban by the

Alternative Methods for Wastewater
Collection and Treatment was updated in
1975

That initial engineering study con-
cluded that the village would have to
spend approximately $1.2 million to
upgrade sewage treatment. Proposals
made by the engineering firm were
rejected, and eventually, the board
decided to look for another engineering
firm and another proposal.

The new engineers, Upchurch,
Davidson & Associates of Mattoon, took
the project on in the late 1970\[CloseCurlyQuote]s. Their
proposal was accepted by the village,
and from May, 1979 to January, 1980 the
firm embarked on the initial design for
the proposed project. .

It was during this period of time that
the Village of Findlay was informed that

a" F

y sewer project if finally complete. Representatives of the village bo
ployees, Harshman, Plumbing, Heating & Electrical and Upchurch, Davidson & Assooc. made a final i
last phase of the $1.8 million project -- the sewage treatment plant last Saturday,

Illinois Environmental Protection
Agency (IEPA). This meant that no new
development -- such as a subdivision of
new homes -- could be constructed
within the village limits until the present
sewer system was upgraded.

Nearly $100,000 was spent during the
design period. Upchurch, Davidson &
Assoc. prepared plans and specifications
for three project contracts, a user charge
study, documents for funding from the
IEPA, the Farmers Home Ad-
ministration and other items. Total cost
-- $93,430.

The next phase of the project, from
February, 1980 to June, 1981 was a pre-
construction period that was expected to
last only a few months. Instead, this
period was stretched to 18 months. The
ensuing delay was caused by a lack of

progress in obtaining land and
easements for right-of-way and com-
pleting legal and financial work to get the
project rolling. |

The board changed engineering firms.
Then it changed attorneys. R. Glen
Wright, who had represented the village
in preliminary plans for the sewer
project, was elected Shelby County
State\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Attorney.

The board hired E.C. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Chris\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Eber-
spacher III to replace Wright. The board
was back to square one in obtaining
easements and land for the project.

By the time all of the legal work was
done, 18 months had elapsed and bids
were finally prepared and issued for
three phases of the project. The bids
were due in July, 1981.
