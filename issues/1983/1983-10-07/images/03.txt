Members of the Findlay Junior
Woman's Club enjoyed a potluck supper

In addition to the 15 members that
altended the supper-meeting, the club
welcomed two guests, Tammy Lynch
and Paula Kurzman.

During the business meeting, Mrs.
Dever announced that the program
committee would include Margie Uphoff,
Mary Wright, Nancy Lutz and Peggy
Bowers. Program books will be prepared
for the October meeting. Several
suggestions have been made for program
ideas for the new club year.

Several sign-up sheets were passed
and club members volunteered for the
calling committee, reading hour com-
mittee and ways and means.

A report on the recent sale of pizzas
was given at the meeting. The entire
profits of the recent pizza sale will go
toward a special fund to remodel and
operate the new Findlay Community
Building. The new community center will
be housed in the old village hall.

A total of 320 pizzas were made by
members of the club at the United
Methodist Church. There was no figure
available yet on what the profits were.

Mrs. Dever gave a brief report on the
outcome of the ice cream social that the
Findlay Junior Woman\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Club sponsored
during Findlay Days. A total of 15 gallons
of ice cream were served during the
event.

This was the first year that the club
held the ice cream social at the Findlay
fire station, and club members felt it was
advantageous to hold the event at this
location. A total profit of $320 was made
from the ice cream social.

In related action, the majority of the
club members voted to donate $50 to the
Findlay Jaycees to cover expenses in-
curred from Findlay Days.

There was a brief discussion about the
Reading Hour program for pre-
schoolers. Some of the club members felt
that the age requirement should be in-
creased so the class size would not be too
big too handle.

After the discussion, Mrs. Dever said
that she was referring the question of an
age requirement to the committee, since

Marjorie Uphoff.

The committee decided that children
who are four years old by Dec. 1 are
eligible for the pre-school program. This
will mean that all of the children in the
program will be entering kindergarten at
Findlay Grade School next fall.

Several members volunteered to help
with reading hour. Classes officially
started Wednesday, Oct. 5. The program
is held each Wednesday morning in the
audio visual room of Findlay Grade
School.

A motion was approved for the club to
sell a variety of nuts, including pecans
again this fall. Carolyn Lash will be in
charge of the nut sales. Club members
have offered nuts for sale for holiday
baking for the past two years.

Secret pals for the past year were
revealed and new secret pals were
drawn.

Dever, Vicki Oldham, Nancy Beem,
Deanna Uphoff, Carolyn Lash, Sondra
Diss, Elaine Smith, Gloria Livergood,
Marjorie Uphoff, Susan Vadakin,
