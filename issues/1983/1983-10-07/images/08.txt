Most people unaware of co-ops

Unless someone is a member of a
cooperative, that person probably
doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know much about

or how they touch his or her life, says
A.L. Wilson, President of the Federal
Land Bank Association of Decatur.

Most consumers likely use cooperative
products regularly, yet don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know it. If
they eat Sunkist citrus or Ocean Spray
cranberries or Riceland Rice or Far-
miand bacon or Diamond walnuts (to

the names, but not that these
organizations are cooperatives,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] adds
Wilson. But with the designation of
October as \[OpenCurlyQuote]Cooperative Month,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
perhaps a few more people will gain a
better understanding of cooperatives, he
continues.

Cooperatives are distinctive from
other forms of business. Perhaps the
biggest difference is that they are owned
by their members, those who use them,
and are directed by representatives
elected by the members from among
their numbers. \[OpenCurlyQuote]Fundamentally,
cooperatives are economic democracy in
action,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Wilson states. }

Cooperatives have deep roots in this
country. They grew out of the frontier
barn raisings and husking bees, ac-
tivities where people joined together to
get the work done more efficiently. In
1752, Benjamin Franklin helped organize
one of this country\[CloseCurlyQuote]s first cooperatives:
The Philadelphia Contributorship for the
Insurance of Homes from Loss of Fire
and Other Hazards.

Through the 1800's, cooperatives
sprang up from the Atlantic to the
Pacific, but they really began to

with the enactment of the Capper-

services for farmers\[CloseCurlyQuote] crops and
livestock. And they brought credit in the
form of the Federal Land Bank and other
segments of the nation\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Farm Credit
System.

These types of cooperatives are still a
mainstay in the rural business com-
munity, but cooperative products and
services have ... and they've
moved to the city. Today, it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s not difficult
to find housing cooperatives, food
cooperatives, day care cooperatives,
health care cooperatives, insurance
cooperatives, and financial cooperatives
(better known as credit unions).

There are 40,000 cooperatives in the
U.S. They come in all sizes. Some are on
the Fortune 500 list; others are smaller,
local businesses. Presently, these
cooperatives serve 60 million people,
States Wilson. And among those 60
million are 1275 farm and rural families
in Macon, DeWitt, Moultrie, Piatt and
Shelby counties who, as members,
currently have $146,790,000 outstanding
in long-term real estate financing
through the Decatur Federal Land Bank
Association.

COOPERATIVES

For 66 years, the Federal Land Bank has
joined other cooperatives in building a
better America by providing farmers with
sound, constructive, long-term credit.

We take pride in being a cooperative and

take this opportunity to salute the
achievements of all cooperatives.
