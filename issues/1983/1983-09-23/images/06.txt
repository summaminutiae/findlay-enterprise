Volleyball teams
drop two games

In the first match the junior varsity
played well and came close to victory
with scores of 12-15 and 9-15.

The varsity won their first game but
lost the match, scoring 15-10, 4-15 and 14-
16.

In Tuesday night\[CloseCurlyQuote]s games against
Lovington the Falcons were defeated
once again.

The junior varsity scores were 4-15 and
0-15, and the varsity scores were 2-15 and
11-15.

Lake still high but
falling slowly

Lake Shelbyville is approximately one
foot above normal summer pool and
falling slowly.

The water temperature ranges from 78
to 82 degrees. Fish are starting to move
into the shallows; many are being caught
in three feet of water -- a strange
development since the water tem-
perature is still high. Largemouth bass
fishing is good, but only about half the
catches are keepers.

Anglers are taking them with one-

quarter ounce spots or gayblades. A few

are taking buzzbaits and small worms. |
Walleye fishing is good, but catches ,
ing small

The fish are taking white hellbenders,
model A bombers and wiggle warts
fished in two to four feet of water on the
flats near Wolf Creek, Sand Creek, Coon
Creek Point, and the Findlay Bridge.

DOC to sponsor
hunting course

A Hunter Safety Course, sponsored by
the Dept. of Conservation and the
Shelbyville Jaycees, will be held from
8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 1 at
Shelby Electric Coop on Route 128 No. in
Shelbyville.

Hunters of all ages are welcome to
attend the course which is eight hours in
length and free of charge. Aspects of
hunting included in the course will be
responsibilities of hunter safety, hunter
ethics, wildlife conservation, fun-
damentals of arms and archery, survival
and first aid, and game care and iden-
tification.

Please call 644-3091 before Sept. 28 to
enroll, or for further information. Bring
a sack lunch -- drink will be provided. Be
ready for an informative and interesting
day learning how to make hunting safer.

Do not bring firearms.

The Dept. of Conservation will issue no
hunting licenses to persons under 16
years of age unless they have previously
held such a license or have satisfactorily
completed a Hunter Safety Course. Many
of the western states are requiring non-
residents to attend and pass a Hunter
Safety Course before a big game hunting
permit is issued.
