Board reviews budget

An annual budget was adopted by the
Findlay Public Library Board at a
meeting held Thursday, Sept. 15. The
budget and a financial statement was
presented to the board by president
Harriet Baker.

The new budget calls for tentative
expenses of $5,500. The breakdown is:
$3,000 for books; $700 for magazines; $200
for telephone; $600 for supplies; $700 for
furniture and $300 for miscellaneous.
Mrs. Baker stressed that these were just
tentative expenses and they could
change.

Income for the budget would be $3,700
from village tax money; $1,000 from
revenue sharing; $700 from Illinois state
library grants; and $100 from
miscellaneous.

The budget includes the following
provision, \[OpenCurlyQuote]We are establishing a special
revenue fund for any expended amount
left in the library budget for the rental
and repair of a building for library
purposes or for the purchase of a site and
for the construction and equipment of a
building for library purpoes.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]

Mrs. Baker explained that such a
provision is necessary for both the
purposes of receiving state grant monies
and for the library\[CloseCurlyQuote]s affiliation with the
Rolling Prairie Libraries System.

A financial statement for the fiscal
year July 1, 1982 to June 30, 1983 was also
reviewed by the board. Receipts, in-
cluding funds brought forward from the
previous fiscal year, totaled $6,089.10.

The following disbursements were
made, according to the financial
statement: $3,083.41 for books; $191 for
the telephone; $70 for magazines; $10 fee
refund; $541.56 for supplies; $1,965.38 for
furniture; and $7.70 for the summer
reading program. Expenditures totalled

$5,869.15.

In line with an adjustment requested
by Rolling Prairies, the board approved
a motion to amend the by-laws and
change the fiscal year from May 1 to
April 30 to a new fiscal year of July 1 to
June 30.

Mrs. Baker said that not only Rolling
Prairies had requested the change, but
Illinois Secretary of State and State
Librarian Jim Edgar had made the
request. This will put the library in the
same fiscal year as other libraries
throughout the state.

A committee of library board metn-
bers Cherise Cruit and Susan Vadakin
were appointed to plan an appreciation
dinner for library volunteers. The
Suggestion for an appreciation dinner
was made by board member Sonja Jay.

Mrs. Jay pointed out that the library
has been in operation over a year now
operated completely with volunteer help.
She told the board that the efforts of the
39 plus volunteers needed to be
recognized.

A trustee workshop will be held for
library board members at Rolling
Prairie Libraries Thursday, Oct. 13. Mrs.
Baker asked for persons who would be
interested in attending the workshop.

The library continues to be open five
days per week, in a classroom at the
Findlay Grade School. Library patrons
can check out materials during regular
library hours: 2 to 4 p.m. Monday
through Friday and 6 to 8 p.m. Tuesday
and Thursday.

In addition to Mrs. Baker, Mrs. Jay,
Mrs. Cruit and Mrs. Vadakin, other
board members are Nedra Hash, Doris
Farris and Lou Carroll.

Mrs. Jay can be contacted about
volunteer work in the library.
