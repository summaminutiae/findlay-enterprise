going to or coming from school. The

time for drivers to beware.

About 8:30 Monday morning it started
to sprinkle lightly, and I heard one
farmer refer to it as a dry drizzle. I think
that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s mostly what we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve had this
summer in lieu of rain. I'd like to see
enough of the wet stuff to at least settle
the dust. |

The Bank of Findlay\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Open House
looked like a tremendous success to me.
One thing about the bank\[CloseCurlyQuote]s expansion
that makes me feel good is that all local
labor was used, and all supplies that
could be bought here, were. I wish more
people could see the importance of
spending money in their town. Actually
it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s to everybody's benefit. The Bank has
grown by leaps and bounds, and I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d like
to see the village grow that fast. It can,
but it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s up to us whether it does or not. If
it does die (God forbid) -- I can say I did

I'd like to know who stays up till 4 a.m.

I recently read a newspaper article
that said the State of Illinois got some
extra money for roads. If that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s the case
then I'd like to see some of that money
spent on the road to Route 128. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s so
narrow it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s dangerous. I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t drive it
any oftener than I have to, and I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m not
happy to drive it at all. There are a lot of
two unit vehicles and big boats, campers
and mobile homes traveling that road,
and it doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t leave much room for the
driver in the other lane. I hope the state
will be sympathetic to our needs and
widen the road before we have a tragic
accident on it.

Earlier the state reported that it was
scheduled to be fixed sometime around
1985. Well I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m afraid that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s not soon
enough. It should have been widened
when the lake traffic started so it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s way
past due.

And wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t it be nice if Shelby
County would deem it necessary to pave
their part of the Findlay Road. I read a
document that was written and signed by
board members many years ago, and
that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s what it said -- they\[CloseCurlyQuote]d do it when
they deemed it . I wonder if
they ever will? It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s my opinion that
blacktoping it several times costs as
much as paving it in the first place.

A lot of Findlians have commented
that they appreciated getting their
August gas bill paid by the village.
Almost all of them said they wish it
would have been the January or
February bills. Me, too.
