The refreshments were good at the Bank of Findlay open house as these three
Findlay youngsters found out. In addition to 1,200 hamburgers, the bank served
popcorn, potato chips, ice cream, snow cones and coffee to persons attending
the open house.

Greg Bohlen explains some of the operations of the Bank of Findlay to a group
of youngsters at the bank\[CloseCurlyQuote]s open held Friday and Saturday. Persons of all ages
enjoyed touring the facilities and the refreshments served under the two tents in

the parking lot.

Y, ILLINOS 6254

__2z. Around the county

commercial
varieties averaged 40.18 bushels per
acre. The top yielding variety was Van
Horn SM10E with a yield of 56.4 bushels.

Other yields were Migro HP2530, 40.7;
Americana Rebel, 45.9; BSR 201, 49.7;
Sprite, 43.9; Williams 82, 43.1; Fayette,
38.0; Asgrow A3659, 37.4; Hobbit, 36.7;
Hisoy 352, 35.1; Pella, 34.6; JMS 3482,
32.6; and Sun Prairie GLA100, 25.3.

We have approximately harvested one-
third of the beans on the Bohlen Ex-
tension plots in Penn Township, and
yields have ranged from 32 to 39 bushels
per acre. This is about ten bushels higher
than we have previously expected.

We are still receiving a lot of reports of
bean yields around the 20-bushel mark
throughout Shelby County. Overall. !
have heard bean yields reported between
8 bushels and as high as 39 bushels per
acre.

Fall Fertilization Program

Because of the stressed growing
condition we have received several
questions in regard to planning fall
fertility programs.

Farmers should plan to make ad-
justments in fall fertility program ac-
cording to reduction in yield. There is a
direct correlation between yields and the
amount of fertilizer removed.

For example, 140 bushels of corn will
remove an actual 60 pounds of phosphate
and 39 pounds of potash; whereas, 90
bushel of corn would only remove 39

pounds of actual phosphate and 25
pounds of actual potash.

So when planning your fall fertility
program you can reduce the amount of
application according to the percent of
reduction in yield received from your
crop in 1983. Hopefully, you do have soil
test results to base your decision on along
with yield data from 1983 and fertilizer
application applied for the 1983 crop.

If you need additional information on
the amount of fertility removed by a
particular crop contact the Cooperative
Extension Office and we will provide you
with this information.

Conservation Expo is Oct. 19-20

At least 34 conservation tillage tools
and 255 of corn residue tillage plots will
be featured at the 1983 Conservation
Tillage Expo Oct. 19 and 20 just outside
Atlanta, Ill.

The featured equipment will include
no-till planters and drills, no-till
anhydrous applicators that cut through
heavy residue, and chisels and disks to
replace your moldboard plow on rolling
ground.

With so many farmers in the state
converting to some form of conservation
tillage, conservation techniques are
continually being refined. The Expo can
serve as an important way to keep on top
of the latest information.

To reach the Expo site, take Interstate
90 to Atlanta, Ill. and follow exit 140 east
for 3% miles. The Expo site will be on
your right.

The Expo is sponsored by the Illinois
Dept. of Agriculture, with assistance
from the U of I Cooperative Extension
Service, the Soil Conservation Service,
the Agricultural Stablization and Con-
servation Service, the Logan County Soil
and Water Conservation District.

There is no charge to attend the Expo.

Rain dates have been scheduled for
Oct. 24 and 25.

Films cover synthetic fuels, weather

The major efforts underway to develop
acceptable synthetic fuels are profiled in
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Quest for Synthetic Fuels,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] now
available from Central Illinois Public

Service Co.
A second film, also available from
CIPS, \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]Improving Weather

Management,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] details major projects
underway to modify the weather and
more accurately forecast severe storms.

In \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Quest for Synthetic Fuels\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] the
cameraman uses footage from many
research sites to show the major sources
and methods being used to perfect
snyfuels. These include biomass
snyfuels, Midwest gasohol made from
corn, and methanol brewed from Pacific
Ocean kelp. The film also provides a look

RAINFALL VERY LIGHT

Rainfall was very light for the
recorded period, Sept. 9-15 over much of
Shelby County. The highest was .54 in-
ches in Rose Township. Several town-
ships recorded just a trace or no rainfall.

In the northern end of the county, the
rainfall was .14 inches for Penn Town-
ship; .40 for Pickaway Township; .15 for
Todd\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Point Township; .15 for Okaw
Township; and .05 for Ridge Township.

In the second film, the cameraman

power of storms and other types of
weather. It also details major projects
being researched to modify the weather.
These include the hurricane proving
flights of Project Storm Fury, Hailstorm
Missions, a program to produce smaller
hailstones; and project Face II, being
used over Florida to test cloud seeding to
see if it can increase rainfall over dry
farmlands.

These films and other science related
and current topic films may be scheduled
free of charge through the nearest CIPS
office.
