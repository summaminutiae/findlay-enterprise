eld from 1 to 6 p.m. Tuesday, Aug.

need to collect 900 units of blood daily to
meet the needs of area hospitals,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] ex-

be your family members, neighbors, co-
workers, even yourself,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Miss Coventry

by Hash. The Findlay Community Unit

State aid payments. Other Shelby courity

tax anticipation warrant #4. The warrant
is for $25,000 for the education fund.

students early if the weather was ex-
cessively hot. High temperatures outside
and a lack of air conditioning have
contributed to high temperatures in both
the grade school and high school
buildings. |

repaired. One section of the area over the
library was re-roofed.
