Reye Syndrome Rare Complications of
Children\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Winter Illnesses

Complications stemming from
children\[CloseCurlyQuote]s winter illnesses are not un-
common, and Reye Syndrome is one such
condition that has been getting a lot of
attention lately. Reye Syndrome
(pronounced \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]rye\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]) is a rare, acute
condition that can be fatal. The federal
Food and Drug Administration reports
that some studies show an association
between children under 16 taking aspirin
for viral conditions, such as influenza
and chicken pox, and their developing
Reye Snydrome.

For this reason, children who have flu
or chicken pox should not be given
aspirin or aspirin-containing products
unless it has been recommended by the

doctor, according to University of Illinois ss
specialist and assistant rate

Extension health
director Lawrence B. O\[CloseCurlyQuote]Reilly.

sudden vomiting, violent headaches and
unusual behavior in children who appear
to be recovering from an often mild viral
illness. The child may become sleepy and
lethargic, but still responsive. Within
half a day, the child can become
disoriented, combative and delirious, he
said.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]If untreated, the child can go into a
coma and die,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]so if these
symptoms are present, take your child
for immediate medical attention. I do
want to emphasize, that Reye Syndrome
is a very rare disease entity.
Nonetheless, people should realize the
strongly suspected connection between
Reye Syndrome and the use of aspirin in
children under 16 years of age.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

If the child does have Reye Snydrome,

emergency care can be provided. In the
hospital, the child can receive blood, and
body fluids can be monitored and
corrected. A respirator is available if
breathing is failing, and if necessary,
surgery can be performed to relieve
pressure on the brain. The usual hospital
stay for treatment of Reye Syndrome is
three to ten days. The patient must be
closely watched and will likely be in an
intensive care unit. The child is con-
sidered out of danger when blood
chemistry, respiration and other signs
have been stable for 48 hours.

The illness is not a \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]new\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] one, O\[CloseCurlyQuote]Reilly
said. It was first identified in 1963 by
Ralph D. Reye, M.D., in Sydney,
Australia.

To help parents know what Reye
Syndrome is, what the symptoms are and
what emergency treatment may be
needed, the FDA has a fact sheet called
Reye Syndrome. For your free copy,
