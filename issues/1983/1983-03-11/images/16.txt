Is siding a good insulator? Even an

doorways and windows and in cor-
nerboards. Air space created by ap
plying an uninsulated siding panel over a
wall has an \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]R\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] value of about .75 (new
home insulation standards in the north
are R-19 for sidewalls, R-30 for attic
ceilings). While .75 is not that high, it is a
contribution toward saving energy.

Insulated siding\[OpenCurlyQuote]panels have an \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]R\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
value of between 2 and 3. In addition,
homeowners can select from a wide
variety of sheathing products which can
be applied under siding, or can have stud
spaces blown with an insulating material
if the siding is going over wood clap-
board. Insulated siding is usually a wise
investment as the additional cost may be
recovered in reduced energy usage.

If I just moved into an aluminum sided
home that needs a panel replaced, how
can | tell the brand? If you don't know
name of the contractor who applied the
siding, you may be able to make some
observations that will help you deter-
mine the brand. F or example:

While most manufacturers make a
woodgrain siding, the grains vary from
brand to brand and you should be able to
tell one from another.

On a smooth, eight-inch wide siding
panel, check the thickness of the butt
(botton) edge; it will vary from % to %
inch between brands.

A drip bead that deflects water off the
surface is a distinguishing factor. It's
generally located on the face of the
panel, at the bottom, where it meets the
butt edge.

Weep holes (most siding panels have
them on the butt edge) are small
openings that allow moisture to escape
from behind siding. They vary in size and

Do you know where your soffits are?
That's the spot under eaves (overhangs)
of a house. It's also an area that is prone
to peeling paint and, without proper
maintenance, can cause ventilation

eliminates the need for constant back-
breaking scraping and repainting.
Hunter Douglas Inc., a leading

of aluminum soffits,

are perforated so that moisture does not
build up under the panel and bugs and
insects are filtered oul. The company
also suggests using soffits for finishing
ceilings of porches, carports, and
other éxtensive outdoor rooms.

Trim is good contrast

White aluminum trim and rainware add interesting contrast to the blue siding on
