Planning for retirement
includes solar power unit

home. She said that a different type of
unit has been found in the past to be a fire
hazard -- the panels sumply get too hot in
the sun.

However, the unit Lat is in operation
at the Sullivan home inchedes several
safeguards including an adequate in
sulation covering. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The pipes get too hot
to handle, even in the cold winter mon-
ths,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Mrs. Sullivan said.

She said they have installed a tem-
perature probe to determine how hot the
water is that is heated up by the solar
panels. The probe isn't quite accurate,
but it gives the Sullivan's some idea of
the efficiency of the system

The unit gets much hotter than the
winter high of 124 degrees in the summer
months and will supply the Sullivans with
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]more than enough hot water for
whatever we want now,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Mrs. Sullivan
related.

The Sullivan's children are married
and live away from home, so their
energy needs have been trimmed down
in recent years, however, Mrs. Sullivan
said that both she and her husband were
concerned with the future.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]In the long range -- you might not see
it right now -- power is going to be ex-
pensive,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] she related. She pointed to
decontrol of natural gas and other fac-
tors which are driving the price of energy
sky high.

Mrs. Sullivan also said that her
husband was concerned with his
retirement years -- which are ap
proximately 20 years away. She said
that, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It's the end result we're looking
for\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] -- cheaper utility bills.

The type of system that the Sullivans
installed can also be used to heat their
home. They're looking at this and \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Bill
has also been thinking about getting a
heat pump.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Within the next two years, an a
conditioning system will be possible with
the solar unit, and although some peapie
might be excited about tus, Mrs
Sullivan isn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t interested.

She said that they have enough trees --
natural air conditioning -- and that she
doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t like the closed stuffy feeling that
air conditioning gives a home.

THE SENIOR SULLIVANS are not the
only members of the family with an
interest in solar power. Mrs. Sullivan
said that her son, Mike, laid off from his
job at Caterpillar, took a course in solar
power in Colorado and is busy installing
the units in that state.

Mike is working as a subcontractor
installing flat solar units. She said he
recently installed five different units at a
home which enable the homeowner to not
only heat his home and hot water heater,
but a swimming pool, sauna and hot tub.

She said that her son related, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]he
never had a more satisfying job,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] as the
one he has now installing solar systems.

WHEN MOST PEOPLE think about
solar energy, they associate its ap
plication with new homes or more
modern structures. Another Moultrie
County family, Mr. and Mrs. Richard
Wildman, became excited about the idea
of solar energy and installed a solar
collection unit on their rural Sullivan
home.

Their home, built in 1910, has a lot of
space to heat -- two stories and a
basement. So, in addition to making the
initial investment for solar power to
provide an alternate energy source for
the hot water heater, the Wildmans also
added the necessary equipment to make
it possible to provide heat for their home.

Mrs. Wildman said that the solar unit
heats all of the family of five's hot water
and supplements their heat. She said that

She has noticed some reduction in the

cost of power bills as a result of the solar F

unit. The unit was installed around
Thanksgiving and has been in operation
since.

When the winter is over, they will
compare the cost of propane and have 4
better idea of the possible savings. Mrs.
Wildman said she felt like the mild
winter weather has had some impact on
their energy usage as well.

The family has noticed a definite
reduction in their electric bills. This,
Mrs. Wildman feels, is directly a result of
the solar unit's replacement of hot water
rather than heating it with electricity.

However, she feels that \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We'll really
be able to tell a lot bigger difference this
summer, with a lot more showers, baths
and loads of laundry." The family in-
cludes three children, ages eight, six and
five, and their use of hot water increases
in the warmer months.

With a big older home, the power bills
were getting bigger, so the Wildmans
looked to solar energy as an alternative.

Like the Sullivans, the Wildmans
learned about solar power after seeing a
presentation made by Solar Resources.

So, an investment in solar collection
systems seems to be a viable alternative
for reducing energy bills -- for both a
new home and an older home. As the idea
spreads, more homes in Moultrie County
will become equipped for the future -
with an eye to the sun.

DOOR SWEEPS CAN HELP

A door sweep will help keep the room
cleaner without lifting a broom. Door
sweeps are used to reduce air infiltration
at the bottom of doors. They are usually
vinyl or felt-backed metal strips sold
by the running foot and can be installed
as a do-it-yourself project.

A self-installed sweep will stop drafts
and dusty airleeds. The strip is cut to
within 1/16 inch of the door width and at-
tached to the inside of the door so that the
strip just touches the carpeting of floor.
