Inexpensive unit

Pete tn, FA Phe
Sullivan High School grounds and
maintenance supervisor Doug Graven
got the idea for this solar collector from
a science magazine. The idea in
terested SHS ne | students and one
student in particular, Richard Hor
tenstine, went to work, completing the
unit in two weeks. The solar collection
panel, which provides heat for the aq
classroom, cost only $50 to construct

There are all types of solar energy
systems. Most require some type of
capital investment to construct and the
savings is figured in the amount of
money saved because of reduced energy
costs.

This is not, however, the case with a
solar unit constructed and in use al
Sullivan High School. The unit -- unlike
most solar energy systems -- cost onl)
$50 to construct.

The unit was built as a project by
Sullivan High School agriculture studen-

-- \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]out of scrap materials,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] ag in-
structor Steve Hendrix said.

Hendrix explained that the solar unit
was initially the idea of grounds and
maintenance supervisor Doug Graven
He started talking about solar power af.
ter reading several articles in science
magazines.

The idea caught on and one student in
particular, Richard Hortenstine, worked
on the project until it was complete. Hor-
tenstine said that he put in about two
hours a day on the solar heat collector for
about two weeks.

Other agriculture students assisted
with the project and lent their assistance
The ag students are proud of the project
and even on a warm spring day want to
show off its capabilities

The solar collector is constructed with
soda pop cans thal have been sprayed
black and bolted to a prece of corregated
steel roofing. Hendrix said that all the
students helped with the project by
drinking the soda pop and the steel
roofing was donated from someone's
scrap pile

The unit is insulated with styrofoam
with foul backing that was also donated to
the school for the project, thereby
keeping the cost down even further

Hendrix explained that the pop cans
were spray painted black because rather
than reflecting the sunlight, the cans ab-
sorb the heat and give off energy,
thereby causing heat to build up

The solar unit is located just outside
the high school ag classroom and a piece
of stovepipe conveys the heat throug, the
window and into the classroom. The
biggest expense of the project was the
cost of replacing the window glass with a
piece of plexiglass so that a hole could be
cut for the stove pipe.

A small fan is used to bring heat into
the classroom. The fan was constructed
out of scrap materials. Hendrix said the
motor was off a piece of equpment that
was junked some time ago. The fan was
from an old motor that burned up on a
school bus
