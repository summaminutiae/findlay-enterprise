High quality diverted acreage mixes

to assure good uniform distribution of the
herbicide. Prowl offers a little more
flexibility since it does not have to be
incorporated if you have a nice rain
within a week or so to move it into the
soil. Surflan is also a dinitroaniline that
can be surfaced applied and may fit
some situations. --, is - :

The acetanilide herbicides, Lasso and
Dual, also have performed well. Soybean
tolerance is very good and you have the
option of incorporation or surface ap-
plication. Amiben can give excellent
control of annual grass weeds and also be
quite helpful for the control of some
broadleaf weeds. It may be incorporated
or surface applied and is approved for
use in several combinations.

One of the decisions you'll likely be
facing is whether to stay with soil applied
treatments or move to one of the new
postemergence herbicides, Poast or
Fusilade, if cleared for grass control.
Research suggests that you can let
foxtail grow with soybeans for the first
few weeks during the vegetative stage of
soybean growth without significant loss
in yield.

You don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have to control weeds early,
but you do need to control early weeds,
within a few weeks after planting. If you
plan to go the postemergence route, you
will need dry enough weather to make
the application.. And you may need to
explain to the landlord or banker why
you're leaving the weeds.

Fortunately soybeans have very good
tolerance to Poast and Fusilade as they

grass
weeds. If you are readily reducing tillage
and leaving much crop residue, the
postemergence approach may have
some advantages.
Hoelon is another postemergence
herbicide that can control small annual
grasses and can be help for volunteer
corn, either broadcast or as a spot
treatment.
