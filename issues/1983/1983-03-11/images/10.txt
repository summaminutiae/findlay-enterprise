Home power bills seem to defy conservation efforts

abundant energy

Living in a temperate climate, most
central Illinots residents have watched
their power bills zoom fram modest
levels to Lake up an increasing portion of
their income. In some cases, power bills
rose to seemingly spectacular highs
despite efforts at energy conservation.

Ten years ago, solar power didn't
appear to be a viable solution to bringing
down power bills. Through the years,
though, several different solar power
systems have evolved, and these systems
appear to be able to bring some relief to
Slaggering power bills

Two Moultrie County families became
interested in solar power and have in-

for their hommes, bul in the future could
provide heat for the entire home and air

Mr. and Mrs. William Sullivan, 13 lols
Court, Bethany, and Mr. and Mrs
Richard Wildman of rural Sullivan in-
stalled the solar units this past fall. Both

top of their home's garage. They chose
this location because of several tall trees
on their property and the location meant
the panels were not blocked.

She explained that the solar panels
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]track the sun\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and as the sun moves
from east to west, the panels move too,
giving maximum exposure. If the sun
goes behind the clouds, she went on to
explain, the panels move east and then if
the clouds clear up, the panels will move
in that direction.

Copper tubing with water heated by the
solar panels runs from the roof of the

utility room. Thes storage tank feeds
darectly into the hot water heater.

Even on a winter day, the solar anil
enables the water to be heated to a
maximum of 124 degrees. On a winter
day when there isn't any sunshine, Mrs
Sullivan explained, the gas will kick on

» gs an alternate source, and there will be

hot water

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They (energy experts) say a hot
water heater accounts for 3 percent of
utility bills,\[CloseCurlyQuote] Mrs. Sullivan stated. So any
alternative to heating water should bring
about some relef to power bills.

She said that, initially, she and her
hushand invested in only the necessar)
equipment to at least partially heat their
hore with solar power

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Eventually we plan to hook up to our
furnace\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] with the solar unit for an
alternate energy source.

When asked if she had noticed a
reduction in her power bills, Mrs
Sullivan said that since the system was
new, there were no Complete figures

ORIGINALLY, the Sullivans were

\[OpenCurlyQuote]The Envelope House\[CloseCurlyQuote]

STEPPING TOWARD ENERGY INDEPENDENCE
V.J. Koufman is designing ond co..structing double-shell or \[OpenCurlyQuote]envelope\[CloseCurlyQuote] houses. The unique feature of this type of home is an air space or \[OpenCurlyQuote]envelope\[CloseCurlyQuote] con-
sisting of o south-focing greenhouse, roof covity, north wall cavity and craw! space. Heot from the sun and earth worms the oir within this envelope which
seporates the interior living spaces from cold winter temperatures outside. This allows the living areas to respond to 50 degree weather rother than neor-
rero temperotures. Therefore the home is easier to heat and more comfortable

HOW IT WORKS

WINTER NEATING: During the doy, the sun heats the air in the south-focing greenhouse. This worm air rises and flows through the roof cavity. The worm air
in the roof cavity cools as it travels further from the greenhouse. it flows down the north wall cavity and into the craw! spoce. The oir gives up more of its
heat to the house and eorth as it travels through the craw! space and back into the greenhouse to be heated again. This circulation of worm air distributes
heat uniformly throughout the entire skin ond mass of the structure ond works os long as the sun shines into the greenhouse.

At night or on cloudy days something different happens. The earth within the insulated foundation stays in the 50°s yeor-round. As the temperature of the
envelope space drops, heat from the eorth rises and keeps the oir temperature in the envelope space in the 40's or 50's

This combination of daytime solor heat ond evening eorth heot provides relatively stable and comfortable conditions in the living oreos
SUMMER VENTILATION AND COOLING: During hot summer doys the roof cavity and greenhouse (which ore insulated from the interior) prevent the sun from
hitting the living spaces, thus reducing heat gain. Air within the greenhouse ond oir cavity heats up and is allowed to escape through skylights ond vents
located at the top of the greenhouse. This pulls air from north windows and doors through the house. At night, the windows ore opened up to allow air to cir-
culate through the house cooling down its moss for the next day.
