When I first read about the proposed
closing of Eagle Creek state park, the
article said fishing, and
boating would be allowed. In Friday\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
Shelbyville Daily Union Phil Chiles,
supervisor of information programming
for the Illinois Department of Con-

remain open.

Now I certainly question the truth of
that. I happen to know that I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve seen
office buildings at both parks. Maybe the
one at Wolf Creek has been vacated. I
strongly object to the closing of the park

cuts

for selfish reasons. Anything that

way over the national average, and I
believe Shelby County is below the state
average.

I agree with the Country Boy Jim
that there may have to be
some tax hikes and my opinion is that the
legislators will agree in part with the
hikes but I sure as heck don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t want him to
have his cake and eat it. If the tax hikes
pass I want that park open. In the early
days of Lake Shelbyville I heard
promises of a swimming beach near
Findlay and something about a lodge in
our area too. Well they managed to build
a beach at Shelbyville and Sullivan but
somehow the Findlay beach fell by the
wayside.
I object to the fact that they close the
park that Findlay gets the most business

There still seems to be a lot of flu bugs
around. I hope I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t get it again. I had
my turn and believe me, I sympathize
with anyone who gets it. I wonder if this
beautiful weather we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve had all winter
keeps the bug from dying out? I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
want anymore to do with the flu but I love
the weather. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s been about the nicest
warmest winter I can remember.

There\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a bad bump at the approach to
the east side of the Findlay bridge. I
wonder if that could have had anything to
do with Zetta Nichols accident last week?
It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a dangerous bump and I hope the
county will soon do something about it.

Findlay should be buzzing this
weekend with the annual community sale
being held on Saturday and the Donkey

the ball game. I appreciate the fact that
the EMT-A\[CloseCurlyQuote]s are interested in buying
added equipment so they can better
serve the community. They do a heck of a
lot for us and buying a ticket would be
such a small way of showing we ap-
preciate them. If you won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be able to
attend make a donation anyway.

If you haven\[CloseCurlyQuote]t registered to vote now\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
the time to do it so you'll be able to vote in
the upcoming village election.
Remember, if you don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t vote you don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
get to complain.
