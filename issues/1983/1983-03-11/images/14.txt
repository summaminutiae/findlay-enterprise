Heating bills are the largest part of annual househould expenses

--~ \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote])

By Scott Blomeley, Jr.

In recent studies, almost 8) percent of
home buyers cited energy efficiency as
the most important consideration in
buying a new home Besides mortgage
payments and taxes, the home healing
bill is the largest annual household ex-
pense, and many homeowners may be
receiving high heating bills because of an
inefficient system. The present trend is
to update these inefficient heating
systems

A heat pump is one such home im-
provement project that can help update
older inefficient heating systems, and
thus help hold down high heating costs

It works on the reverse cycle
refrigeration principle as a heat transfer
unit. During the warm months it takes
the heat from the indoor air and tran-
sfers it outdoors. During the cold months
it takes the heat from outdoor air and
transfers it toindoors.

A heat pump can work on this principle
because no matter how cold it is, there is
always some degree of heat in the air. So,
really there is no such thing as cold,
there are just varying degrees of heat
This is what makes a heat pump cost ef-
ficient, because it costs less to move
existing heat from outdoor air to the in-
doors than to produce new heat

A heat pump is really an air con-
ditioner that draws heat from indoor air

and transfers it outdoors, bel & also
reverses itself, by means of a special
valve, to draw heat from the ouldoor air
to a house's interior. The heal source is
not restricted to just outdoor air. It may
be city water, a lake, pond or well water,
or the earth: therefore, burning fuel

Heat pumps heal by passing air
through a coil where heat is extracted
and super cooled air is returned to the
outdoors. Heat is compressed and tran-
sferred to another coil where indoor air
passes through and heat is extracted and
transferred indoors

Where well water is the source for
heat, water is pumped through a tank
containing a coil through which a cold
gas refrigerant flows. The refrigerant,
after absorbing heat units from the well
water, passes into an electrically
operated compressor which compresses
the refrigerant gas to a liquid, inten-
sifying its heat. The hot refrigerant then
flows through a second water tank. The
water absorbing refrigerant heal is sent
into a radiator through which air is
blown. Warm air is thus curculated
Waste water is returned to the ground

As a cooling system, the heat pump
reverses the flow of household air. In
stead of passing the air over the conden-
ser to warm it, the air is passed over the
evaporator where heat is extracted from
the air, and cool air returns to the rooms.
The heat is transferred to a condenser

Roof 15 years old?
Then it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s time to reroof

If your roof has passed its fifteenth
birthday, it's no cause for celebration.
This is a milestone year for most
shingled roofs, and it usually means their
days are numbered. Sooner or later they
have to be replaced.

For most homeowners, replacing a
roof is an expensive once-in-a-lifetime
decision. A careful study of the products
on the market and estimates from at
least two contractors are a must.

First, there are a few simple inspection
steps you can take to determine whether
you need a new roof. Besides an outright
leak, some of the warning signs are: bare
spots where granules have worn off;
missing shingles, or those with broken or
curled edges; rotting, warping or
splitting of wooden shingles; cracking or
shipping of slate or clay roofs.

If you need a new roof, there are a
number of options to consider. Con-
sumers have shown a preference for
asphalt shingles which offer durability at
an affordable price. Unlike the felt-based
asphalt roofs available in the past, today
there are multiple choices available.
New colors, styles, textures and
materials can complicate your decision.

Whatever you spend, you'll want to get
the most for your money. That's why
many roofing experts such as those at
Bird & Son,*East Walpole, Mass.,
manufacturer of building materials since
17%, recommend consulting a roofing
contractor.

Most contractors will provide a free
estimate of labor and material costs.
They also will recommend combinations
that coordinate with the color of your
home and right texture, style and shingle
material to suit your needs.

According to Bird & Son, fiber glass is
by far the preferred shingle among
contractors and homeowners. Fiber
glass shingles with laminated con-
struction present a distinctive woodlike
appearance while offering the protection
of a \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Class A\[CloseCurlyQuote] Underwriters Laboratory
fire-resistance rating.

Although most shingles use asphalt as
a component, shingles with a fiber glass
mat are superior to felt-based shingles
because they offer far greater durability.

CONDITION AIR INEXPENSIVELY

If spring comes, can summer be far
behind. Before the warm weather
arrives, consider installing a ceiling fan
or two. They add an attractive decorator
touch to any room and are far less expen-
sive to operate than air conditioners.

The fiber glass mat is coated with the
asphalt and then covered with a thick
coat of rock granules that protect a
shingle from the sun, often its worst
enemy.

To protect your roof from fierce winds,
most fiber glass shingles are treated with
spots of adhesive. Bird & Son says its
fiber glass shingles are capable of
standing up to extremely heavy winds,
and thus can warranty your roof for up to
25 years. Your contractor should be able
to inform you about all of these features
and more

If you're not wetting wet from a leaky
roof, take the time to consider all of your
options. Consult with more than one
contractor -- it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s free. Getting a second
opinion and knowing your options can
mean big savings in the long run. It could
be one of the \[OpenCurlyQuote]shingle\[CloseCurlyQuote] most important
decisions you'll ever make about your
home.
