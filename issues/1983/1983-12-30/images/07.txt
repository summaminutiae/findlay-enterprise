1,397 FmHA loans made

The Farmers Home Administration
(FmHA) made 1,397 home mortgage
loans to Illinois families in fiscal year
1983 that ended Sept. 30, FmHA State
Director Robert W. Chambers an-
nounced today.

FmHA is a credit ey or
Department of Agriculture. It pro
loan assistance to farmers and other
rural residents who need credit but who
cannot get it from private banks or other
lending institutions. The loans are to be
repaid in full, plus interest to the U.S.
Government. FmHA has more than 2,000
field offices throughout the country with
60 in Illinois.

Preliminary figures show that
nationally the agency provided more
than 60,000 loans to families across the
country who were without safe, decent
and sanitary housing. Another 20,000
families were afforded an opportunity at
better housing through 1,000 loans that
financed rental housing construction.

The total amount of FmHA housing
loans for the fiscal year was $2.6 billion.
In Illinois, FmHA provided 1,397 single
family home loans totalling $52,168,200,
Robert Chambers said. Twenty-one
rental housing loans were made for
$8,915,730. Total housing loans for the
year amounted to $61,566,200.
