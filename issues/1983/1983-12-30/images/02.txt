Me Thinks 1, ric Briney

For the first time in my life I did what

even a
little bit thankful for the chicken noodle
soup. But there always comes a better
day, and that was the day after Christ-
mas. It wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t a really good day, but at
least I and a lot of other people who were
snowbound were able to celebrate the

I let my faucets drip all through the
frigid weather, so I didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have any pipes
to thaw. I heard that a lot of people did. I
did get a little shook up Monday morning
when I tried to get some water and

indlay lost its oldest resident when
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Aunt\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Sarah Tinnea was found dead in

she had been in all the years since there\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
been an American Legion post in Fin-

As I write this Tuesday morning thie\[CloseCurlyQuote]
village streets are the slickest I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve ever
known them to be. When I get out I creep
around like I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m a hundred years old.
When I was a kid I never thought about
falling so I didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t. But I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m sure scared of
falling now. I guess age makes the dif-
ference.

Two days from now we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll start a brand
new year. Let\[CloseCurlyQuote]s hope that in 1984 there
will be less talk of war and less talk of the
scary missles. Let\[CloseCurlyQuote]s hope that heads of
nations will be able to negotiate a peace
settlement and let people live without the
fear of war hanging over their heads. |
would also wish for an improvement in
the economy, that every person who
works for a living could have a job and
that the farmers could have a better
year. Then I'd love to see the winter of \[CloseCurlyQuote]84
be better than the winter started out in
83, and selfishly I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll wish that Pauline
gets to go to Florida this year. Oh well, I

have lots of hopes for the coming year, --

and I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m sure you do to. May it be a good
year for all of you Enterprise readers
near and far. May your fondest hopes
come true, and may you have the hap-
piest New Year ever.

You may notice that I stayed strictly
away from resolutions this time. I think I
won't make any, then I won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have any to
break. I just don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t seem to be able to keep
resolutions. .

Take heed while you celebrate the
entrance of the new year.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]If you serve alcoholic beverages, it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
always a good idea to serve plenty of

food. Not only do snacks make a tasty

addition to your party, but they can also
slow down the rate at which alcohol is
absorbed by the body. Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t force drinks
