Church panel blasts gun policy

by Pauline Briney

The Bank of Findlay\[CloseCurlyQuote]s practice of
offering depositors guns in lieu of in-
terest has come under attack again, this
time from the Ohio Council of Churches.

In a June 1 letter to the Bank of Findlay
the council chastised the bank\[CloseCurlyQuote]s policy of
offering guns to prospective depositors,
and resolved that \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]the Ohio Council of
Churches deplore the promotional

of their program . . . (and) urges all
persons of its constituency to refrain
from opening deposits in the Bank of
Findlay.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Though the offer of handguns is
oriented around display-type \[OpenCurlyQuote]collector\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
sets\[CloseCurlyQuote], the council said in its letter, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]even
such intention plays upon the attitudes of
casual acceptance of the handgun in our

society.

The Ohio Council of Churches adopted
its resolutions against the gun program
because \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]it reflects our continued

a major factor in the high level of
violence in our society.\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]

The July 22 issue of \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Gun Week\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] will
publish the council\[CloseCurlyQuote]s initial letter as well
as the Bank of Findlay's response.

In a June 8 letter responding to the
council\[CloseCurlyQuote]s resolution, the Bank of Findlay
cited the Second Amendment of the
United States Constitution and the Bible
in defending its practice. \[OpenCurlyQuote]Why don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t we
take a look at the Bible, and our Con-
stitution (of which the Bible is the
framework), and make a decision about
gun ownership,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] the letter signed by
bank executives, Greg Bohlen and James
Livergood, stated.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]In your resolution, you state that the
unchecked use and flow of handguns by
the general population contribute greatly
to the number of violent occurrences in
our society. I suggest that it is not the

In an apparent irony, the World
Council of Churches -- under whose vast
umbrella the Ohio Council of Churches
falls -- has come under fire for indirectly
supplying guns to terrorists throughout
the world. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]60 Minutes\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] recently
reported money from the World Council
of Churches was being used to purchase
AK-47 weapons for terrorists.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They have no business telling the
Bank of Findlay or anyone else they
shouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t buy arms or be armed, Greg
Bohlen, senior vice-president of the
