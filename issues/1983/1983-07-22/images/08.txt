saves energy!

Most heating systems have to create heat, so

it costs more to operate them. The heat pump
simply uses heat that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s already in the air,
moving it from one place to the other.

In winter, the heat pump gathers heat that
exists in the outside air (even when the
temperature is well below freezing the air
contains heat) and \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]pumps\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] it inside your home
to keep you warm.

In summer, it becomes an air conditioner,
removing the heat from the air inside your home
to keep you cool.

Saves money, too!

The heat pump is highly efficient. It produces
about two units of heating energy for each unit
of electric energy it uses.

If you\[CloseCurlyQuote]re replacing your heating system or
building a home or business, consider the heat
pump for efficient, economical, year-round
comfort.

Savings,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and read all about it. |
