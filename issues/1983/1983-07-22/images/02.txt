Letter to the Editor

Letter to the Editor:

I would like to compliment
reviewer on the review of the plays at the
Little Theatre in Sullivan.

After attending several of the plays, I
found the reveiws to be pretty accurate.
only does the reviewer criticize
where I agreed needed to be
but the compliments
on the actors and scenery

supporting. Sounds like a good deal to
me.

Dan Crane\[CloseCurlyQuote]s in a heap of trouble. What

prominent public figure. I couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t help
but think how much he paid for exposure
when he was campaigning compared to
the exposure he got for free when he
stumbled. From what I read the 17 year
old girl is going scott free, and her name
is being withheld. I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t agree with that.
She also was a guilty party. It still takes
two to tango no matter how you look at it.
Does his whole life have to be ruined
because he made a mistake? I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
particularly like the man as a politician,
and of course I didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t vote for him. I
guess what really bothers me is that his
wife and children will forever be hurt by
all of the publicity. Surely in his terms in
office he did some good things, but we
didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t hear television and radios blaring
them out, nor did we see whole pages of
newspaper print about it. Fair\[CloseCurlyQuote]s fair, and
that 17 year old page couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have been
innocent. She should pay the fiddler too.

It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a hot, hot summer, and wouldn't it
be nice to run out to a beach at Eagle
Creek State Park. That beach has been in

moola invested in it. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s not like they\[CloseCurlyQuote]d
have to start from scratch.

At 1:30 today (Friday) there\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll be an
official re-opening of the park, and I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m
happy to see it opened again. The event is
open to the public, so I think I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll go just to
show my appreciation. If you want to
