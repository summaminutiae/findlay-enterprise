Youth drowns in Lake Taylorville

Yancy Scott Bleavins, 19, of the Fin-
diay and Moweaqua areas, was found
drowned early Sunday morning in Lake
Taylorville. Bleavins apparently
drowned after diving into an unfamiliar
area of the lake.

No one witnessed the drowning, but
authorites believe Bleavins dove from a
dock into 4% feet of shallow water in the
Bishop Cove area at the east end of the
lake at about 1 a.m.

Christian Coroner Thomas E.

~ Doyle said Bleavins may have attended a

large party being held at the lake at the
time of the drowning.

Bleavins was a large person, Doyle
said, and may have suffered spinal cord
injuries when he dove into the water.
Evidence indicates Bleavins struck his
head on the bottom of the lake, Doyle

to added.

The drowning probably occurred about
1 a.m., Doyle said, but the body was not
discovered until about 2:30 am. by
Krista Alexander of Taylorville and
Robert Hogan of Kincaid. The two had
been swimming and were returning to
shore when they discovered the body.

Bleavins\[CloseCurlyQuote] body was recovered from the
lake by Kevin Bruel of Taylorville.

Positive identification of the body was

A coroner\[CloseCurlyQuote]s office spokesperson quoted
Bleavins\[CloseCurlyQuote] father as saying the youth was
an excellent swimmer.

Doyle said an inquest will be held once

reports on Bleavins are
available.
