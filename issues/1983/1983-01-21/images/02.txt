I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m glad to see Findlay High School is
celebra

Well, I'll bet a lot more people have
heard of Findlay than ever did before.
Actually it should be a good for the

don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t want to wait forever to get it.

As I write this column on Jan. 16
there\[CloseCurlyQuote]s still no snow. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s almost un-
believable that we\[CloseCurlyQuote]re into winter this far
and no snow. It makes me happy, but I
feel sorry for those who've invested in
snowmobiles. Maybe I should learn to
ride a snowmobile, then I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d be happier
when we get a snow storm. One thing I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m
grateful for -- the mild winter has sure
helped save fuel bills from being so high.
With all of the elderly and unemployed
people it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a good year to have a mild
winter. Let\[CloseCurlyQuote]s hope it stays that way.

Why did gas companies buy expensive
foreign gas when there\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a glut of cheap
gas here in our own nation? I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think
they should be allowed to pass their
mistake on to the consumer. Luckily we
get our natural gas from National Gas
Pipe Line, and I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t believe they\[CloseCurlyQuote]re
selling Algerian gas, so maybe we won't
get the raises that some other users will.
I hope not.

I hope villagers will soon be able to
meet our newest trustee, Dave Thurber.
He\[CloseCurlyQuote]s our new gas commissioner and
doing a fine job. He has a lot of expertise
to share with us, and we feel fortunate to
have him.

The most tired female I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve seen in a
long time was Terry Yantis. When I saw
her Monday she was not moving
anymore of her body parts than she had
to and moving those very gently. She
volunteered to skate in a skate-a-thon in
Shelbyville Sunday afternoon --
volunteered to skate fifty miles, would
you believe. Well not having skated for
about 25 years she tuckered out in less
than 50 miles, but she did make 27. I
think that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s great. Congratulations,
Terry!

Letters
to the editor

To The Town and Outlying
People of Findlay,

I would like to express in note a
hearty thank you to all for the
great way in which you have made me
and my family feel at home in the Fin-
diay community.

Findlay is a fine town to live in. You
have made it that for me and my family.

You people are so friendly to people.
That is a good reputation to make for

urselves.

yo

It may be a while before I get to know
all of you better but I look forward to
being able to call you all by name.

All of you are welcome to call on me
for any help that I or my wife or children
can offer you. We want to do our part to
help keep Findlay a fine town. You
already have my prayers.

The Lord helped to prepare me in
many respects for life in Findlay. One
thing I am thinking of is your railroad
tracker, I got accustomed to them when
we lived at New Orleans Baptist
Seminary. We were located ap-
proximately 200 yards from the rails.

I grew up on a farm in South Carolina
and in 1969 I farmed 1,500 acres with my
father who is deceased as of Jan. 15,
1962. I miss him as I know some of you
miss your parents too.

For three years I lived in Anderson,
S.C., a town of 30,000 or so, while my wife
finished nursing school; so I am familiar
with city life. Findlay is not to big or

of all stations in life, rich or poor, small
or great and young or old and there in
between, or the weak and the strong or

I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t always do it but I try to leave
the judgement of people up to the Lord.
He loves evén those He judges and I love

_ them too-This leaves me free to love all

of you too.

Your in Christ,
