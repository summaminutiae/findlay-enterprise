A scheme to raise deposits at a local
bank has drawn national attention to

Findlay.

Three months ago the Bank of Findlay
launched a promotion which would give
a pair of handguns to investors in lieu of
interest. A story about the promotion
appeared shortly after in a regional
daily newspaper. -

That\[CloseCurlyQuote]s as far as it got . . . until two
weeks ago when a free-lance reporter for
the New York Times visited Findlay and
filed a story.

Since that time; Findlay has received
a great deal of attention with reporters
calling the bank from magazines,
newspapers and radio stations and the
presence of several television camera
crews from central Illinois and the
national news networks.

Findlians were not only able to see
their small town on local television
newscasts, but they were algo treated on

to appearances by two
bank vice presidents on national
television.

Senior vice president Jim Livergood
appeared on the NBC \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Today Show\[CloseCurlyQuote]\and
was interviewed in NBC\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Chicago studio
by Garrick Utley. His television in-
terview was at approximately 7:10 a.m.
Those Findlians quick with the television
dial could catch the other bank vice
president, Greg Bohlen, at 7:15 a.m. on
the CBS \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Morning News\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. Bohlen was
interviewed in New York by Diane
Sawyer.

The third national television network
picked up on the story later in the week
and on Wednesday ABC \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]World News
Tonight\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] spent the day in Findlay
filming at the Bank of Findlay and
Wooter\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Sport Shop.

All over what appeared to bea simple arts

promotion to give investors their interest
without having to wait too long.

What the promotion consisted of was
placing $2,500 in a six year certificate of
deposit with the Bank of Findlay and
receiving (in lieu of interest) a pair of
Colt handguns, the Colt .357 Python and
the .22 Diamondback.

In the advertisement promoting the
guns, potential investors are informed
that their $2,500 investment could yield
as much as 15.5 percent return.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Both of these handguns are sought
after collectors items and come enclosed
in a handcrafted walnut showcase. The
total retail- value of this package is
$1,153.95,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] the advertisement states.

What it comes down to is that the guns
have already doubled in value over the
past six years and over the next six
years their value is supposed to increase
even more.

The original idea for the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]guns for
interest\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] promotion came from Gene
Wooters, owner and operator of Wooter\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
Sports Shop. He and Livergood first
discussed the promotion about 242 years

0.

Wooters pointed out that guns were
appreciating in value better than almost
any other investment. Livergood backed

Livergood stated.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]This money will definitely stay in the
bank for six years. There is no with-
drawal,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Livergood said of the cer-
tificates.

He went on to explain that the guns
were American made, with United Auto
Workers labor and that the cases were
made by Findlay High School industrial

Bre

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Some banks give kitchen appliances.
In six years they will be worn out. These
guns will still be appreciating in value,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
Livergood asserted. .
Bohlen also stressed that the
promotion was going to enable the Bank
of Findlay to make more money
available to the Findlay area. He feels
the promotion has been very successful.
He said that the area is now aware that
the Bank of Findlay is \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]here to stay\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote].
The other Findlay business that has
been closely involved with the \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]guns for
interest\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] project is Wooters Sports Shop.
The guns are not only ordered through
Wooter\[CloseCurlyQuote]s but they are dispersed through
that business establishment as well.
An investor just doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t walk into the
Bank of Findlay and plunk down $2,500
and walk away with his case of han-
dguns. An investor must have an Illinois
Firearms Owners ID Card before he is
sent to pick up the pieces at the sports

Out-of-state investors likewise must
have the proper license before receiving
the guns through dealers.

Most of the response to the gun

on has been favorable. Bohlen
reported that there has been only one
