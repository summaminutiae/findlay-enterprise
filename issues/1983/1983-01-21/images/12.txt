However, most of the attention from
the news media has centered around the

much trouble with that, and both have
carefully pointed out that the guns are
collectors items -- that if they are fired,
it will decrease their value.

So meanwhile, Findlay has been
receiving more publicity than an
average town (population 810) receives
in a lifetime, with the possible exception
of Times Beach, Mo. All because Gene
Wooters had a different idea for raising
more deposits at the bank.

go,

It followed her to school one day, to
school one day, to school one day.
It followed her to school one day which

was against the rules.

But the teacher wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t there so the
children laughed and played, laughed
and played.

So the children laughed and played to see
a ram in school.

Old Mother Hubbard went to the cup-

But when she came there the cupboard

And so the poor dog had none.

But when she came back the poor dog

Country Gentlemen and
Investors Alike Will
Enjoy This Special
Investment Opportunity!

The Bank of Findlay is pleased and privileged to offer a new special type of Certificate of Deposit that can earn as much as a 15.5% return
on your investment. An investment that allows you to own one of the finest pair of handguns available today. Here is how it works.

When you place 2,500 dollars in a six year C.D. with the Bank of Findlay you receive a pair of Colt handguns. The Colt .357 Python and the
.22 Diamondback in lieu of interest. Both of these handguns are sought after collectors items and come enclosed in a handcrafted walnut
showcase. The total retail value of this package is $1,153.95* This makes the annual return on your investment equal to 7.7% but read on to
see how that return can more than double. |

While many other assets have depreciated in value this pair of handguns has increased in value over 101 % during the past six years. While --
no investment is truly \[OpenCurlyQuote]Blue Chip\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] this special savings program is nearly foolproof. Your money is insured by the FDIC, you get the enjoyment of
the guns and the value of the guns appreciates regularly. In fact if the guns appreciate at the same rate over the next years as they have the

past six years, the total return on your investment will be equal to 15.5%. Better than any rate now available.

To reserve your set, simply fill out the coupon and send it back to us. Or if you prefer, you may give us a call at 756-8573 and ask to talk
