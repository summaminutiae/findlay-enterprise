The Millers are a very special family. Bill and June Miller of Pontiac have been
camping near Findlay this past week. Although both the Millers have cerebral
palsy, camping isn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t hard because they have the assistance of their support dog,
Duke. Duke made a recent appearance in Springfield where he helped convince
the state legislature that support dogs should be allowed in public places. Fin-
dlian Betty Perry spent some time visiting with the Millers this week.

Farris resignation accepted

by Michael Lang

The Findlay Village Board accepted
the resignation of board member Chuck
Farris at its meeting Monday night.
Farris, in.a letter to the board, cited a
work schedule conflict as the reason
behind his decision to step down. The
board will appoint a new member in the
near future.

In another matter, the water tower
should be filled Tuesday, it was reported,
with the boil order expected to end
Thursday morning. :

Tim Spellman informed the board the
cable company will begin installation
work Wednesday morning.

The long-standing sewer project was,
once again, a topic of considerable
considerable. Hal Harshman addressed
the board on the topic.

Calling the situation \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]very satisying,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]
Harshman said the manufacturer,
Purestream Industries Inc., had become
very cooperative. Harshman predicted
Purestream would bear the entire ex-
pense for reinstalling new submersible
pumps and lines.

New designs, which were approved by
Leon Siekerka, call for the submersible
pumps to be incresased from three to
four inches with new piping installed.

Calling the president of Purestream an
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]honorable man,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Harshman predicted
installation of the new parts would take
seven to ten days. But, the arrival date of

the new pumps is uncertain, at least two
weeks away, he said.

In a related matter, problems with the
drying bed gates were reported at the
meeting. The gates are cracked, causing
leakage into the nearby stream. Board
member Dave Thurber said the \[OpenCurlyQuote]design
specifications are at fault.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

In other action, the board approved a
redrafted liquor ordianance. Village
Attorney Chris Eberspacher said the new
ordianance was written \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]in the exact
language of the statute.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The board also
approved a motion to refund money to
those who purchased liquor licenses
under the old ordinance and apply for a
license under the new ordinance.

After considering the budget for the
next fiscal year -- which stands at
$654,000 -- Thurber insisted increasing
revenue sharing appropriations for some
areas of the budget. Following
discussion, the revised appropriation
ordianance was unanimously appoved by
the board.

The board also approved a motion to
allow Eberspacher to begin weed
abatement proceedures on two local

properties.

The board also approyed both the
village bills and the treasurer's report.

In another matter, Mayor Pauline
Briney appointed board members
Thurber, Ron McClain and Dwight Riley
to look into consultant candidates for
running tests on village utility
operations.

have been spending some time camping
recently at Lake Shelbyville.

Bill and June Miller of Pontiac spend
most of their summer camping in Illinois
State Parks because they are both
disabled and can camp free for 15 days at
each park. They are both living on a
limited income. Both the Millers have
cerebral palsy.

Meeting at a handicapped dance in
Chicago, the Millers have been married
for 16 years. Although Bill has cerebral
Palsy causing a speech impediment and
some diffi walking (he sometimes
falls) he has worked 13 of their 16 years
together as a janitor.

The couple drives a 1974 Plymouth van
with a hydraulic lift to get June and her
wheelchair in. June has celebral palsy
and has been confined to a wheel chair all
of her life.

President of a new chapter she started
this year, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Support Dogs for the Han-
dicapped, Inc.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] June has eleven board
members working under her, none of
whom are This is a new
organization and this is the only chapter
in Illinois.

The Masons of Champaign County has
nominated June for \[OpenCurlyQuote]Woman of the Year
For The Disabled.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The United Cerebral
Palsy Chapter of Decatur has also
nominated her. The contest is sponsored

There is a special members of their
family, their dog \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Duke\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]. Duke was
trained by the Ohio Chapter of Support
Dogs. The dog walks with Bill and helps
him balance, the dog will also break
Bill\[CloseCurlyQuote]s fall and will not let him go all the
way down. If he does, the dog helps him

up.

The dog also performs many other
useful tasks. He can turn a light on for
the Millers with a spceial device, he
hands June the receiver when the
telephone rings, he will pick up coins and
any other object they drop and knows
which one of them it belongs to and
returns it to that one.

Duke walks beside June when she goes
out in her electrically operated
wheelchair.

The Millers will go anywhere in Illinois
and demonstrate their support dog with

organization pay for their gas. They also\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
ask for donations to help pay for Duke
and help support their chapter.

Duke cost $3,000 according to the
Millers, as do all support dogs.

The chapter has one dog, a red
Doberman Pinscher who has already had
his basic training and is ready to go to
assist a disabled person. When the
person accepts the dog, the dog goes
through at least six more weeks of
training because the trainer has to know
what the new owner wants the dog to do.
The trainer teaches the dog these things.
Then the person and the dog have to go
through at least three more weeks of

The Support Dog chapter has a head
trainer and an assistant trainer. They
meet at least once a month except during
the summer months. The chapter has a
four year old boy with muscular
dystrophy who lives in Wheeling. The
chapter will train his dog (a mountaineer
dog that resembles a bear) for him. --

The chapter accepts dogs donated to
them if they are at least 24\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] from
shoulder to floor and if they weigh at
least 60 Ibs. The dogs can be collies,
mixed, any kind -- i
breeds of dogs are trainable. The dogs
must be at least nine months old and no
older than 2% years.

On May 3, the Millers, Duke and the
chapter\[CloseCurlyQuote]s assistant trainer went to
Springfield to the House of Represen-
tatives to try to include support dogs into
Bill 1037 that dogs owned by the deaf and
the blind to enter any public place. The
Millers demonstrated Duke to the
Representatives and later the committee
voted 14 to 0 to include support dogs. It
passed both houses.

The bill is now on the Governor\[CloseCurlyQuote]s desk
waiting to be signed. When Gov.
Thompson is ready to sign the Millers
will take Duke to perform to the governor
and they will present the governor with a
Statue of a dog with a plaque on it that
says, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Support Dogs For The Han-
dicapped.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]

The Millers are currently spending two
weeks camping near Findlay and they
demonstrated Duke at the Bethany
Fourth of July celebration. The Millers
and Duke have also made a guest ap-
pearance on the television program,
P.M. Magazine and will be on the
program again in August or early
September.
