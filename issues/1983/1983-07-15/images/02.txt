The Department of Conservation
promised us a beach a long time ago. The
beach was planned for Eagle Creek State
Park. Since they\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve invested so much
money in the project so far I think they
should finish it. They already have water
and sewer lines and one parking lot at the
sight so it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s not as if they had to start

By the time you read this the water

I interviewed a man and wife who are
both victims of cerebral palsy at Wolf
Creek Saturday afternoon and met their
Support dog, Duke. That dog is really
trained to help them live more useful and

productive lives. I thought he was just a
friendly Doberman Pinscher, and they
say he is. But you could have fooled me,
and he did. When I'd been standing there
about three minutes the dog suddenly
lunged at me, and his bark wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
exactly friendly. He scared me half to
death, and from then on they trusted
Duke a lot farther than I did. They said
he wouldn't hurt me -- and he didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t -- so
I guess they knew their canine pretty
well. The problem was I didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know him.
After the dog scared me out of my wits,

- Mrs. Miller told me to empty my hands. I

was holding a camera, purse and a pad
and pencil. She said the dog doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t like
people who approach her and her
husband to have anything in their hands.
I guess Duke thought the things I was
holding were a threat to his masters.
Well, I laid them down alright, then she
told me I could pick up my pad and pencil
and write. I was a bit hesitant about
picking anything up, but she was right,
he didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t bother me anymore. That dog
would protect those people at the expense
of his own life. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m convinced of that, but
for awhile I was more worried about
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Yours truly\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] life.

I went to a wedding reception at the
Sullivan Country Club Saturday night,
you
believe I dropped my whole plate of food,
plate and all on the dance floor
outside the door. I guess I shouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have

been so embarrassed, probably only
about 150 people witnessed the accident.

I was promised we'd have a public
access telephone. I know we'll get it, I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m
just wondering when.

Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t forget! There'll be no paper the
last week of July. That\[CloseCurlyQuote]s vacation time.
Hooray!
