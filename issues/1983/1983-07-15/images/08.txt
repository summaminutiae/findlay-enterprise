THE FINDLAY ENTERPRISE--FINDLAY, ILLINOIS 62534

at The Little Theatre

Many in the audience recalled seeing a
past performance of \[OpenCurlyQuote]The Fantasticks\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
at the Little Theatre and remarked about
the differences in the performance.

One of the obvious differences is the set
design. The fantasy theme was rein-
forced by a surrealistic set strewn with
gray and colonial blue shredded fabric.
Technical director Jeffrey M. Horvath
said he had staged \[OpenCurlyQuote]The Fantasticks\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] six
times and each time designed a different
set. He said, following the performance,
that he had no special idea for the set
just, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]rags on a string looked good to
me.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]

Lending lots of support to the unusual
Stage appearance was lighting which
contributed to the songs and dialogue. I
think that only one change can be made.
During a sequence when it was supposed
to be a moonlit evening, the lighting
appeared too bright. (This is a switch;
usually I think there isn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t enough light! )

This is the first time that Robert
Newman, who performs on television\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
day-time soap \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Guiding Light\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], has
performed in \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Fantasticks\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and the
first time in two years he has performed
on the live stage.

Newman thoroughly enjoyed himself

at the Little Theatre and as a result,
everyone in the audience thought his
was wonderful. He made a

performance belonged to Martina
Vidmar as the Mute. A

part, she had to perform somewhat in the
shadow of everyone else, providing

part that was beautifully portrayed by
Martina. Her ballet-like performance
helped add to the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]fantasy\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] theme of
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Fantasticks.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

No review would be completed without
mention of the last two performers, Don
Orlando as the Actor Henry and Kip
Wahl as his bumbling assistant, Mor-
timer. Both are absolutely hilarious in
their roles, and the audience didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t even

need any dialogue to laugh at their an-
tics.

The music in \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Fantasticks\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] was

for the most part beautifully performed
by only three musicians -- David Fehr as
the pianist, Jay Miller as the Harpist and
David Via as the drummer.

The use of the harp in the last two
productions at the Little Theatre is a
marvelous addition. Miller's per-

Sporting a beard which gives him a sinister aspect in his role as El Gallo in \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The
Fansticks\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] which opened Tuesday night at The Little Theatre is Robert
Newman. A regular on the television show \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Guiding Light\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote], this is
Newman's first live stage appearance in two years.

Prvbs formance also helped add to the fantasy

theme of the show, especially in the
sequences between lovers Matt and
Luisa.

One of the musical selections has

Temained a popular tune since \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The

Fantasticks\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] was first staged over 25
years ago. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Try to Remember\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] is a
timeless kind of melody. When Newman
first appears on stage singing the song
(added to the surrealistic setting) you
really begin to feel like such a story could
be lost in the mists of time, or it could be
just yesterday. When you leave the

Director Michele Vacca has done an
excellent job in Sullivan staging \[OpenCurlyQuote]The
Fantasticks.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Not the usual musical or
play-with-music that theatre goers are
more used to, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Fantisticks\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] allows
room for creativity and imagination.
Vacca used lots of both directing the
performers.
