The electric heat pump...

not just a
fair-weather friend!

Foul weather's ahead! If you\[CloseCurlyQuote]re replacing your
heating system, now\[CloseCurlyQuote]s the time--before winter
gets here--to consider a heat pump.

it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s economical.

Most heating systems cost more to operate
because they have to create heat. The heat
pump simply moves heat already in the air from
\[OpenCurlyQuote]one place to the other.

In winter, it will gather heat that exists in cold
outside air and move it inside your home to
keep you warm. In summer, it becomes an air
conditioner, removing heat from air inside your
home to keep you cool.

t's efficient.
The heat pump produces about two units of
heating energy for every unit of electric energy it

uses.
