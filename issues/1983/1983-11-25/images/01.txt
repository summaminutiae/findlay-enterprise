School board members seated

Two new board members were seated,
and a new president was elected at the
Nov. 15 meeting of the Findlay School
Board.

The old board canvassed the votes of
the Nov. 8 school board election. Re-
elected to terms on the board were
Duane Uphoff and Rob Winings. New
board members seated last Tuesday
were Ben Dawdy and Lonnie Francisco.

Forest Herron was recognized for 19
years and seven months of service on the
school board. He retired from the board
and did not seek re-election. President
Herb Bricker completed seven years on
the school board.

Lewis Coleman was elected to a two-
year term as board president after the
new board members were seated. Uphoff
will remain baord secretary for another
one-year term,

Following a discussion on whether to
change the board meeting night, a
motion was approved to retain the same
schedule, the third Wednesday of each
month. The school board will meet at 8
p.m. in May, June and July; at 7 p.m. in
August, September and October; and at
6:30 p.m. in November, December,
January, February, March and April.

IN OTHER ACTION, unit superin-
tendent Ron Hash reported on in-
formation he had received on life safety
work at a recent meeting he attended.
Hash said that the school district is
currently in compliance having com-
pleted life-safety work in 1972.

\[OpenCurlyQuote]However, there is now a new state law
that a life-safety check be made at all
schools by an architect within the next
two years.

Hash told the board that life safety
bonds can be sold and a tax levied to pay
for any life safety work needed as a
result of the life-safety check. Such a

check will be required every ten years. --

Hash said he hoped to receive more in-
formation about the new life-safety law
at the Illinois School Board Assn. state
convention.

After discussing the new state sick
leave law, the board voted to allow school
district staff members to accrue a total
of 200 days of sick leave and make the
leave total retroactive to Aug. 23, 1983.

Was approved

Hash explained that the bill which
recently passed the General Assembly
because of several
education organizations. A year of sick
leave can now be added to a teacher's
pension. The state of Illinois now
requires 180 sick days.

As a result of the new state law, Hash
suggested that the school board allow
more than 180 sick days (at least 190) so
if an employee becomes ill they will still
have enough sick leave for an extra year
for retirement.

The board acted on the recom-
mendation by extending sick days to 200.

THE ISBA CONVENTION was
discussed by the board, and a motion was
approved allowing for the expenses of
board members and administrators
attending. The board will pay $59 per
night for the three school district ad-
ministrators and school board delegates
attending.

Uphoff was the official
delegate at the convention.

In-service meetings for new board
members will be scheduled around the
first week of December. Hash will
conduct the in-service program on board
policy, meetings, ethics and other topics.
The in-service meetings will be open to
the public.

A request to spend over $4,500 of FFA
funds for new equipment was denied by
the board. FFA adviser Brian Wood
requested the funds to purchase the
following equipment: a drill press at
$1,540; an air compressor at $1,650; a
grinder at $492; and a bender at $897.

The board decided to deny the request
because they felt it was too much money
to spend at this time on new equipment.

Findlay

scoreboard would run at least $2,200.
State aid funds received by the school

district have previously been put into the

building fund. The board decided to put

Findlay senior citizens were treated to a Phanksgiving dinner last Wednesday
mid and served-by members of the Findlay Baptist Church. The 1983
Thanksgiving meal was somewhat of a milestone for the church. Hundreds of
meals have been prepared and served through the years to senior citizens at the

church and at their homes.

The consensus of opinion was the
education fund needed the aid more than
the building fund.

The board voted to have the public
address system checked. The fee will be
$70. If any repairs are necessary, the $70
will be taken off the cost of repairs.

Some cuts were made which involve
the board purchasing state basketball
tournament tickets and meals for
athletes.

The board voted to allow basketball
boys to attend the state tournament on
their own; however, the trip (with the
board picking up the tab for tickets) will
no longer be a school sponsored activity.
The board feels that the money spent for
the trip is needed more for sports
equipment.

If the Findlay basketball players want
to attend the supersectional they will pay
for the tickets, and if enough want to goa
bus will be provided. Tickets to the
Supersectional may be purchased
through the school.

IN RELATED ACTION, the school will
no longer take male or female athletes
out to eat. The board felt it was better to

In other action, the board:
