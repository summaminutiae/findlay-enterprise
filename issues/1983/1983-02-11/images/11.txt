acres.

If your land is diverted from
grain crop production for one year, you
may consider annuals, biennials, or low

seeding. Sweet clover, red clover,
alfalfa, ladion clover, or alsike clover
either alone or in mixture are potential
crops for consideration. The soil con-
sidering value of these crops is similar
since all can-be seeded solid. If they are

well established, they may make a
complete canopy over the soil.

The nitrogen fixation potential of the
crop varies considerably. There are
many variables influencing nitrogen
fixations by legumes. The soil nitrogen
supply is of prime importance. Soils high
in nitrogen will discourage a large
amount of nitrogen fixation. Legumes
will use the soil nitrogen in preference to
rhizobial nitrogen. Some nitrogen limits
nodulation by changing the chemical
identification of lectin, a protein by
which rhizobia attaches to root hairs.

Low cost alfalfa seed are non-certified,
either hardy or non-hardy, and sweet
clover appear to be similar in nitrogen
fixing ability. Red clover nitrogen
fixation is similar to alsike and sweet
clover but the higher seed costs may
make red clover the least attractive of
these. Ladino clover and alsike clover
appear to be good choices. Or a lot of
farmers are preferring a combination of
these clovers and alfalfa. This is also a
very good choice. And helps to keep seed
costs to a minimum.

If you plan to seed corn stalk residue
you'll probably have to prepare a
seedbed before seeding your legumes.
However, if you are planning to feed
soybean residue you can probably get a

Weed Control in Legumes

Several farmers have been asking
about weed control especially chickweed
and .Henbit in established stands of
alfalfa. There are several herbicides
available for weed control in dormant
stands of alfalfa.

Princep can be applied to pure alfalfa _

stands established more than twelve
months. Princep should be applied
before the alfalfa begins growth next
spring. Princep can control many
grasses and broadleaf weeds but will not
control most well established perennials
or biennial weeds.

Kerb can be applied after the last
cutting of the fall to established stands of
clover, or alfalfa. It will control most
