Me Thinks 1 rine eine

I just learned that a teenaged parent
who dropped out of high school is not
able to deal with the responsibility of
being a parent. Now they tell me! I
didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know I wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t supposed to deal
with it, so I didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t do all that bad. I know
why I got a diploma when I was 54 years
old, now I should be able to deal with the
responsibility of being a great grand-
mother. Better late than never, huh?

I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m afraid I'll have to disagree with
the pediatrician I heard tell about this
one TV. In my family we were taught
responsibility very early in life.
Education is great, and I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m all for it, but
I resent the assumption that all
are dumb dumbs. By the age of 12 I
probably knew more about taking care
of children than a lot of more educated
people. I was not a perfect parent, but
neither is anyone else I know. A friend of
mine who majored in child psychology
tried to tell me how I should deal with
problems and a book for me to
read. I didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t read the book, but I put a
lot of faith in good old common sense and
I was sure that my kids probably did
things the book didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t cover. Can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you
just imagine having time to run read a
book everytime a problem arose. Taint

possible.

A lot of villagers have asked me what
the village is going to do with the
recently vacated building that was
formerly used as a fire house. I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
know. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve heard several suggestions
and a few rumors, but as far as I know no
decision for it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s use has yet been decided.

The mini parade at the high school

ho game was cute as could be.
In fact _I enjoyed the mini floats a lot. I
just there\[CloseCurlyQuote]d been more of them. I

also enjoyed the crowning of the king
and queen. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m not sure I enjoyed the
basketball game. Findlay was still on a
roll, and they rolled over my favorite
team. You see I have a favorite guy
playing on the Bethany team. I took a lot
of ribbing about sitting on the wrong side
of the gym, but when the people kidding
me about it get to be grandparents I'll
bet they'll feel the same way and do the
same thing. I only had daughters so I had
a couple of cheerleaders, but I never had
a son play ball. Now I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m having that
pleasure watching my grandsons. Surely
no one would deny me that pleasure.
After four more years I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll no doubt be a
Findlay fan again. I already am except
when Findlay and Bethany meet for a
game.

: L have a new camera so hopefully I'll

have better pictures. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a Cannon Sure
Shot, so if I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t get pictures with it I'll
probably get fired. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m just getting used
to it, and I love it.

I'm still laughing about the absence
excuses sent by parents to a Mobile, Ala.
school. I thought they were hilarious.

In a couple of months we'll be voting in
three new trustees for the village board
and again on the wet-iry issue. If you
aren\[CloseCurlyQuote]t yet registered make sure you
register soon.

Headlines in Feb. 10 issue of the

agree with that statement. We get to
furnish clean up crews, police protection
and ambulance and fire service, but we
come in on the short end of the goodies.
Like the campers do very little business
in our community. We just happen to
maintain a lot of the roads they use to get
to their campsites too. But we get and
really expect little from them after these
long years of having them in our area.
They seem to bring most of their sup-
plies with them instead of spending a few
dollars to help the business in our
community. A few business may get
some cash from the many campers and
fishermen that pass through our village,
but this should be a boom town in the
summertime. None of the Lake
Shelbyville area really has prospered
from the lake traffic. It is clear that the
predictions of expenditures to be made
by recreationists in the area around the
lake were far in excess of what has
actually taken place. The most con-
ee ee
$15 million per year prediction by the
Corps of Engineers. Our best estiamte as
of 1978 was that someone between $2
million and $4.2 million per year would
be spent. These figures were based on
three million visitor days and an
average expenditure per visitor per day
of between 68 cents and $1.40. Cheap
vacation ain\[CloseCurlyQuote]t it? We all know that the
lake visitors are spending much more
than that but they must choose to spend
their cash before they reach our area.
capita increase have not increased as a
result of the lake, but our taxes have.
Wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you know we\[CloseCurlyQuote]d come in on the
short end of the deal. These figures are
based on 1978 information, but I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t see
where it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s changed much.
