Then, as Rev. Jesse opened the Bible to
start his sermon, former Findlian Jeff
Browning walked down the middle aisle
informing Rev. Jesse, today was his day,
and he deserved the day off. Jeff, his wife
Ginny and son Benjamin were visiting
for the weekend from their home in
Grayville where Jeff is minister at the

Following Rev. Browning\[CloseCurlyQuote]s sermon,
church members stayed for a potluck
dinner. Chris Tippit had decorated a
cake that read \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Happy 30th Lyle.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

The Jesses were also surprised Sunday
evening. Again, as Rev. Jesse opened the
Bible and as he started to speak, Forrest
Herron stood up and told the
congregation to follow him outside. Rev.
Jesse had no idea what was going on
outside.

On the church grounds tables were set
up with homemade ice cream, tea, coffee
and a beautiful cake that was decorated
to look exactly like the First Christian
Church of Findlay.

After enjoying the refreshments, the
Jesses were presented with a microwave
oven as a gift from church members.
Then everyone returned inside the
church as Rev. Jesse showed slides of
special events at the church during the
last 30 years.
