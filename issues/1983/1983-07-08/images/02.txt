some reason my dad wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t let us go
until about 2 p.m., and by that time I was
chompin\[CloseCurlyQuote] at the bit.

Then when I got married and moved
out on a farm I was really unhappy. I
almost believed that they baled hay on
the Fourth just to delay my long awaited
trip to Sullivan and Wyman Park. Now,
I'd absolutely refuse to go over there and
walk around and around the carnival
grounds. I also would just have a fit if it
dared rain on my favorite holiday, but
things have changed. I was happy to
wake up to a downpour Monday morning
just because the rain made it cooler. The
only thing I care about the Fourth
anymore is the fact that it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a patriotic
holiday, and I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m patriotic plus. But, I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll
fly no flag today. I can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t find my flag
holder. Ain\[CloseCurlyQuote]t that the pits?

It looks like by the time this week has

beginning to feel that it might be a
lifelong project.

Big Jim got his tax package passed,
and we will get to see the Eagle Creek
Park open once again. That\[CloseCurlyQuote]s nice. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m
glad it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s gonna be open, but I still resent
the fact that they kept it closed during
our most profitable holiday of the year. It
wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t hard to know it wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t open
either. We just didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have nearly as
many tourists around town.

I see that the tax package recently
passed is gonna do great things for the
University of Illinois and probably other
state colleges. That\[CloseCurlyQuote]s great! But I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll bet
they don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t help the grade and high
schools that much. Well, I know one thing
for sure. They\[CloseCurlyQuote]re going at the spending
backwards. If there\[CloseCurlyQuote]s not sufficient
money to pay teachers and keep the
grade and high schools going to give the
kids an education, they\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll never make it
to colleges and universities, and then we
won\[CloseCurlyQuote]tneedthem. --

I was scared out of my wits Sunday
night and was ready to call the village
policeman. Really, the only reason I
didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t was that I was afraid to turn on the

light to look up his number. I thought I

was being bombarded by some
pranksters. Then it finally dawned on me
that apples from the back yard tree were
falling on the tin roof of the dog house.
Gosh, I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m glad I didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t call Johnny. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d
have been the laughing stock of the town.
