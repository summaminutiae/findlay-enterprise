For a while during the month of May when temperatures dipped area farmers
despaired of ever seeing their corn grow \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]knee high by the Fourth of July.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Very
hot, humid weather during the past two weeks turned that despair into delight,
and the corn seemed to skyrocket and it was, indeed, at least knee high by July
4 as Findlian Jane Messmore demonstrated earlier this week.

The now famous gun promotion and
local growth have resulted in a sub-
stantial increase in the Bank of Findlay\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
assets over the past year.
Assets at the local bank have grown by
almost three million dollars from $6.9

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]guns for interest\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] promotion that put
million to local growth.

Nationwide publicity caused local
people to focus on the Bank of Findlay,
Livergood stated. The bank and the town
of Findlay were the focus of news reports
all over the United States and in many
other countries after they decided to
offer a set of handguns in lieu of interest
on a certificate of deposit.

After the extensive publicity generated
by the special promotion and the national
attention, the bank was innundated with
requests for \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]guns for interest.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

As a result of the first gun promotion,
several other gun promotions have been
launched by the bank. These include a set
of guns which commemorate the movie
star John Wayne. Other packages in-
clude a Diamond Back and Python and a
Gold Cup .45 and a .22 Ace. |

Livergood said that the flow of funds
to Findlay is proof that, with some
imagination, small banks can survive
and even prosper nowadays. --

the bank has had installed a telephone
recorder to take messages at night so
calls can be taken 24 hours a day.

The gun promotions continue to be the
most popular, Livergood related. The
trip promotions (vacations in lieu of
interest) have started slowly. There are
plans to advertise these promotions in
the travel supplement of major
newspapers.

As temperatures soared almost to 100 degrees, some small Findlay residents
found respite from the heat in swimming and wading pools. Kari Newman.
daughter of Tom and Charlotte Newman, found her wading pool the perfect

place to spend a hot summer afternoon.
