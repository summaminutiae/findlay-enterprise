Summer electric bills

(Editor\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Note: This is the last of a four-
part series to explain the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]summer
electric rate\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] of Central Illinois Public
Service Co. and some of the payment
assistance programs the utility offers its
customers. )

Illinois Public Service Co. can help offset
seasonally higher cooling costs and plan
their energy bill payments by taking
advantage of the utility\[CloseCurlyQuote]s level payment
plan, called the Equalizer.

R.E. Bowlby, CIPS manager of
customer services, said the

allows customers to lessen the impact of
higher cooling and heating bills by letting
them pay a fixed amount each month.
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]For the customer who wishes to plan
ahead for energy costs, the Equalizer is
an attractive alternative to paying
seasonally higher bills,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said.

How the Equalizer Works

Under the program, a CIPS electric
and/or natural gas customer may sign
up for the Equalizer during any month of
the year. Monthly payments are
calculated by reviewing the customer\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
energy payments over the previous 12-
month period and ing the

average daily energy cost. The

payments will then be based upon that
daily amount for a 30.4-day period.

Bowlby said payments are adjusted if

the customer\[CloseCurlyQuote]s energy use or CIPS\[CloseCurlyQuote] cost

significantly during

and adjusted accordingly at the end of
the 12-month period. Any debit or credit
will be added or subtracted from the
monthly payment for the next 12-month

Bowlby said another payment plan

available to residential customers who -

have problems paying their energy bills
is the Deferred Payment Plan. This plan
allows a customer to pay a portion of the
current bill and

work out such an agreement with our
local office,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Bowlby noted.

Deferred Payment Plan and other
energy payment assistance programs
