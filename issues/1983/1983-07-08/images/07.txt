Last Friday, July 1, the Child
Passenger Restraint Act went into effect.
Parents and

grandparents may be
asking themselves how will this law
affect me.

First let us take a look at the law, it
requires all children 5 years of age and
younger be protected by a child restraint
while riding in cars and other passenger
vehicles.

For children under 2 years of age, this
means a child-restraint device such as a
car seat. For older children, a child-
restraint device is recommended, but a

seat belt will be satisfactory at least for

now.
Then as of July 1 of next year (1984),

state law will require that 2 and 3-year-

olds also ride in child restraint devices.
Drivers found in violation of the law for

a safety seat, even for short trips.

various ailments, from noon Friday, July

the same holiday period. Of the 62
