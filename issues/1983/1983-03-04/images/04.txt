Friday, March 4, 1983
In second round action

Falcons fall
at regional

as the Falcons were edged by Oakland

53-52.

The Falcons had advanced to the semi-
final game
beating the host team, Arcola, by a score
of 68-41 in the first round game of the

tournament.
The Falcons finish the season with a 16-

Findlay was 12-16 at the free throw line
while Arcola was only 3-6.

The win enabled the Falcons to meet
Oakland in the semi-finals. Oakland
defeated Lovington 52-40 in their first
round game.

The Oakland game was not one of the
best efforts of the year for the Falcons as
they just couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t seem to take charge of
the game.

Findlay trailed 12-9 after the first
quarter, but regained the lead in the
second and held it through most of the

game.

The Oaks went ahead by three points
with less than a minute to go, and the
Falcons were forced to foul to get the
ball.

Oakland's Cox scored four perfect free
throws under the pressure and although
the Falcons scored on each possession
after the foul shots, they still wound up
one point short.

Charles Watkins led the scoring in the
very roughly played game with 16 points.

The Falcons completed their season on
a down note, but overall it has to be
viewed as a successful one. The 16-9
record was good, and the second place
finish in the Meridian Conference was
especially pleasing.

They also finished second in the St.
Elmo Holiday Tournament.
