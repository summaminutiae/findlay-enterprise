Penny Roney Stephens sent me this
article titled, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]How to Ruin a Town\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
from the Wilton-Durant, lowa Advocate
News, and said she thought I might like
to use it. Thanks, Penny, I love it.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]For those who'd rather sit around and
gripe, complain or criticize, here\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a
handy-dandy little guide on how to ruin a
town.

) -- Never attend any meetings. Just
sit around and criticize what everyone
else is doing. After all, you are the ex-

pert.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]2 -- Knock your city council. This is a
must. Everyone of them wanted to be
-- just so they could get a little kick-
ba

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]3 -- Continually tear down the school
system. You know more about education
than the teachers, even though you
haven\[CloseCurlyQuote]t been inside a school building
since cousin Robert graduated ten years
ago.
\[OpenCurlyQuote]4 -- Vote against any kind of tax levy
-- whether the purpose is good or not.
You pay more taxes than anyone else,
and besides, you alone know what the
town needs and what it doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t.

\[OpenCurlyQuote]5 -- Make fun of the law enforcement
and fire departments, and call the out of
town ambulance even though you have
one in your own back yard. These people
just pick on the poor guy who doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
deserve a speeding ticket, and the
firemen and ambulance people are just
out there for the glory.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]§ -- Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t ever go to school concerts,

ball games, wrestling matches, school
plays, benefit or exhibits.
Instead sit in a half trance in front of the
\[OpenCurlyQuote]idiot box,\[CloseCurlyQuote] mumbling becaues there\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
never anything to do in this town.

\[OpenCurlyQuote]7 -- Find fault with the service group
projects, but never pay your dues. You
might be asked to serve on a committee,
and you can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be bothered. And
remember, the churches exist mainly for
weddings and funerals anyway.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]8 -- Buy everything you can out of a
discount catalog or mail order book, or at
the Big City Mega-Mall. You know these
firms are the first to come foward with
donations and service to your community
when you have an emergency.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]9 -- Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t support your newspaper.
Other publications contribute much
more to your town. But be sure to jump

the editor the first time Aunt Agatha\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\[CloseCurlyQuote]

visit is left out -- never mind the ten

times it was in.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]10 -- Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t pay your bills on time,

to the local merchants.

_ They're your friends, and they can wait
for their money. |

---- - ee _

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]11 -- Second guess the school coach's
every move .and discuss with friends
whether he or she deserves to be fired or
not. This is quite okay, since you have
first hand knowledge of every move and
attitude from every practice.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]12 -- Spread any rumor or story that
is defamatory or uncomplimentary
about your town and its residents.
Everything you hear must be true, so
why not repeat it? In short your motto
should be, \[OpenCurlyQuote]If it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s good, it can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t happen
here.\[CloseCurlyQuote] That\[CloseCurlyQuote]s how to ruin your town.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

This message spans the years, so it .

live. Only we can do that. Nobody else
can or even wants to.
