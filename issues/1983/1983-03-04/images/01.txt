Area residents protest condition of property
around the Todd\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Point Township building

residents who live in the

A group of
as the Todd\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Point

township building. He said when the
building was first erected, the township
board promised nearby residents trees
and shrubs would be planted. This has
never happened.

Wooters suggested township equip-
ment which is left out on the lot should be
put into the building for looks and to
prohibit children in the neighborhood
from being hurt. He said so much rock
and dirt should not be stores around the

building. He also suggested cutting a
ditch on the west side of the property to
help drain water. Wooters told the board
weeds should also be cut.

Another area neighbor, Roger Lash,
said he would also like to see the
premises look better and that shouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
be a hardship.

Township road commissioner Morris
Nichols told the group the dirt was being
stored at the township building for a
bridge. He also said the sewer con-
struction c y came in and dumped
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]a lot of stuff.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He said he brought the
dirt to the township building to keep from
buying dirt.

Lash said there was no way to keep the
children off the property, but the hazards
could be eliminated and one way was by

keeping equipment stored inside the
ae

There were other questions about
equipment storage and Nichols told the
group and the board when snow plows
were removed, all of the equipment
would fit into the shed.

Nichols said the village of Findlay
dumped rock and patch mix on the
township property without permission
and he told the group no trees were going
to be put on the property.

Township clerk Claude Harbert and
township trustee Paul Bennett both

that the equipment should be
stored inside the building.

Residents attending the meeting were
Jack Howell, Gene Wooters, Leroy
Weakly, Roger Lash and Bill Hubbartt.

4 ttorney General objects in court to increase

Illiois Attorney General Neil F. Har-
tigan filed a motion with the Sangamon
County Circuit Court asking for a stay of
the 77.6 million dollar electric rate in-
crease recently granted Central Illinois
Public Service Company (CIPS) Wed-
nesday.

Attorney General Hartigan asks the
court to suspend the major portion of the
increase because it is attributable to the
Newton II generating plant which

ides 47 percent more generating
power for
mediate

CIPS than it will need in im-
future years to meet peak

demands.

Hartigan asks the court, in a possible
alternative to the stay, to create an
escrow fund to hold the Newton II portion
of the rate increase, until the court
determines whether the utility can
lawfully charge\[CloseCurlyQuote] customers for con-
structing power capacity that is not
required. The question is the central
issue of the lawsuit filed Jan. 31 by
Hartigan against CIPS.

If Hartigan\[CloseCurlyQuote]s request for the stay were
granted, utility consumers would receive
a refund or credit of the major part of the

recent increase in their CIPS bills. If an
escrow fund were established, the same
result would occur if the court ruled in
favor of the Attorney General.

The Illinois Commerce Commission
granted the rate increase to CIPS last
November, and it took effect in
December.

In his lawsuit appealing the Com-
mission\[CloseCurlyQuote]s order, Attorney General
Hartigan stated that the Commission did
not require CIPS to prove the
reasonableness of constructing Newton
II, but accepted the company\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
representations without challenge.

Wreck injures
Zetta Nichols

extricate a Findlay area woman from
her car Wednesday afternoon after she
lost control of her car and crashed into
the guardrail at the west entrance of the
Findlay Bridge.

According to Moultrie County Sheriff
reports, Zetta L. Nichols of R.R. 2.

Bruce Road when she lost contro! of her
car and went off the roadway on the
south shoulder.

Mrs. Nichols car then skidded ap
proximately 120 feet across the roadway
and struck a guardrail on the north side
of the roadway. The sheriff's report said
the road is rock/oil and there is a dip al
the entrance to the Findlay Marina
which may have caused the driver to lose
control. Mrs. Nichols told authorities she
thought she had blown a tire.

Mrs. Nichols was taken by Sullivan
ambulance to Shelby County Memorial
Hospital. On Thursday morning she was
a patient of the Intensive Care Unit
where she was reported to be in \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]great\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

State budget
includes closing
of Eagle Creek

Official announcement of Gov. James
Thompson's intent to close Eagle Creek
State Park near Findlay was made
earlier this week as the governor's
proposed balanced budget for fiscal year
1984 was presented.

Nine t of Conservation sites
will be forced to close and other sites will
have reduced hours, reduced main-
tenance and fewer facilites because of
budget restrictions.

The governor is requesting a
$56,432,400 budget for the DOC for fiscal
1984, and $8 million, or 12.5 percent
reduction, from fiscal 1983 in all funds.

The entire state budget, presented
Wednesday, was called \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]inadequate, but
all we can afford with current revenues,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
the governor stated.

Illinois House Representative Mike
Tate told the Enterprise last week he had
contacted the director of the Dept. of
Conservation and has asked to keep
Eagle Creek State Park open. He said he
would oppose cuts or any layoffs because
he felt the area was hit harder than other
areas and \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t afford the loss of any
jobs.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

He said despite the fact that the park
generated $24,000 in camping fees, ix
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t pay for itself.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Tate serves on the Appropriations
Committee of the Illinois House. He told
the Enterprise there will be 150 layoffs

statewide as a result of the governor\[CloseCurlyQuote]s

austere budget.

Thompson is calling for tax increases
to raise additional revenue and maintain
current services. Tate said he has not
come out and said strongly either way
whether he will support the governor in
this request. He said he was \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]keeping an
open mind.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]
