CONDITION 90! is a \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]warning\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] that the National
Weather Service has forecast the temperature will
reach 90 degrees or higher during the day. We call it a
warning because such a condition can cost you extra
money in unnecessary energy use.

Many appliances you use produce heat. The more you
use appliances during hot, summer days, the more
heat you have to contend with and the more difficult it
is to keep cool.

BUT, YOU CAN BEAT THE HEAT BY WAITING!
Defer the use of major appliances wherever possible
until the cooler evening or early morning hours. That
includes laundry, bathing, dishwashing, baking,
canning, ironing and hair drying. And, set your cooling
thermostat at 78 degrees.

CONDITION 90! can help in the long run to moderate
the higher summer electric rates, too. The hotter the
weather, the more it costs us to produce electricity,
and the greatest demand for electricity is during the
hottest days. So, if customers will put off some of their
use of electricity until the evening or early morning
hours, we'll all benefit.

LISTEN FOR CONDITION 90!

On days when the weather forecast predicts 90
degrees or higher, CIPS will broadcast CONDITION 90!
warning messages On your local radio station. You'll
hear them after 9 a.m. and into the afternoon. When
you hear CONDITION 90!, you'll know it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s time to put
off using those heat-producing appliances until
evening.

SO, LISTEN FOR CONDITION 90! IT\[CloseCurlyQuote]S A PUT-OFF!
