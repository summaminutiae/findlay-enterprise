Schools out, and I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m sure the kids are
delighted. But we have an added
responsibility to watch out for the while
they\[CloseCurlyQuote]re flitting around town, walking or
on bicycles.

Congratulations to the graduates of the
class of 1983. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a happy and sad time
for them. I know they\[CloseCurlyQuote]re ready to attack
the big old world outside, yet they will
have a few misgivings about leaving the
old alma mater and the friends and
faculty that have been a part of their
lives for so many years. Graduation is an
end and also a . They\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve
reached a goal in their lives, and now it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
time to set out and meet new goals.
Congratulations on a job well done.

I talked to some people who were
camping at Eagle Creek State Park
Sunday morning, and they said it is the
most beautiful park of all and they hate
to see it closed. They also said that by
Friday evening it was full. I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t believe
it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s smart for big Jim to close that park
for a lot of reasons -- one of them being
the park is in good shape because the
State has spent a lot of money to get it in
shape and keep it there. Can you imagine
the expense to get it back in shape when
it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s allowed to grow up in weeds anc
brush just for a month or so? The reason
for closing the park has to be political. It
can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be economical because it has
always had good usage. It took in $25,000
in fees last year, and most anyone would
take the job of keeping it up for that
amount. If it is indeed closed we can look
for undesirables to use it for devious
reasons, and we can also expect a lot of
vandalism. There\[CloseCurlyQuote]s been vandalism in
the past when the park was open and
patrolled, so what do they expect to
happen if there\[CloseCurlyQuote]s no one there. Eagle
Creek is not being closed because of low
usage, and it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s not being closed because
it doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t take in its share of money. The
only reason left for closing is that Big
Jim is smacking someone\[CloseCurlyQuote]s hands for not
being for his tax package, and that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
unfair to all of us. I think he needs 40
lashes with a stick from an Eagle Creek
tree. Wet noodles wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t do enough to
get his attention. All I can say for the
country boy right-now is ing si
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]BOO.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Nevertheless the signs are up
right now saying the park will be closed
at 3 p.m. May 30. Wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you know he\[CloseCurlyQuote]d
pick a holiday to kick the campers out
early?

ministration. I liked it and thought you
might also.

Memorial Day
At Gettsyburg, at San Juan Hill,
In Flanders Fields now all is still,
But men still drill and march away
Like you who made Memorial Day.

In Normandy, and on Battan,

At Inchon, Khe Sanh, and in Iran,
Selflessly the need you met.

And now we know we must not forget.

Those who fought and those who fell,
To hear the bell of freedom knell.

We crouch beside your graves today;
These wreaths of vernal buds to lay.

And to you who died for freedom\[CloseCurlyQuote]s sake,
A pledge to carry on we make:

The torch that you so bravely bore
Shall be our beacon evermore.

We pray that by its guiding light
We'll find our course and hold it right.
We hope it may throughout the years
Bring an end to blood and tears.

For we\[CloseCurlyQuote]re a nation proud and free,
And sometimes it is hard to see
Where friendship for our cause abides
And where a foe of freedom hides.

You have found peace while we still weep

And wail o\[CloseCurlyQuote]er charges we must keep.

There\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll be no peace until we find

A way that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s just for all mankind.
--William J. Acker
