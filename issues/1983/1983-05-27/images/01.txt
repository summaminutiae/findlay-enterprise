Governor pressured to reopen Ea

If you venture down to Eagle Creek
State Park this weekend, you may see a
Short, spry, elderly man running around
with paper and pencil in hand.

Don Pierce, an Eagle Creek Park
camping veteran of 10 years, has been
busy collecting signatures on a petition
protesting the closing of the state park.
Pe date, Pierce, 68, has collected more

1,200 signatures on a petition which
urges the Department of Conservation
(DOC) to reconsider closing Eagle Creek
State Park.

Pierce, who hails from Burbank, said
he will continue collecting signatures
through the Memorial Day weekend.

Originally scheduled to close May 31,
the closing date for Eagle Creek State
Park has been moved up one day. The
park will officially close its doors at 3
p.m., Monday, May 30.

A spokesperson at the DOC said the
timing of the Memorial Day closing is
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]very awkward.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] ry

Findlay Mayor Pauline Briney,
amoung others, has called the Memorial
Day closing a political move designed to
gain legislative support for Gov. James
Thompson\[CloseCurlyQuote]s tax plan.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They (state officials) holler and

A DOC letter Pierce received from
Charles Tamminga, associate director
for Lands and Historic Sites, stated the
decision to close Eagle Park was not
arbitrarily made.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We (the DOC) have lost 16 percent of
our full-time permanent staff and 60
percent of our seasonal staff over the last
two fiscal years . . . and given the
proximity of Eagle Creek and Wolf
Creek, we felt it logical to close one of
these areas,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] the letter stated.

The letter further stated that Wolf
Creek State Park -- which realized
almost 379,000 visitors last year com-
pared with Eagle Creek\[CloseCurlyQuote]s 158,000 visitors
-- could more easily absorb an added
influx of campers.

Eagle Creek Park is one of nine DOC

sites which, due to a lack of funds, will be
forced to close over the Memorial Day
weekend. Gov. Thompson announced the
park closures on March 2.

The future for Eagle Creek Park is
uncertain. Much depends on whether or
not the govornor\[CloseCurlyQuote]s tax plan is approved
by the Legislature.

When Thompson announced the
agency-by-agency allocation of his
proposed tax plan Monday, he included
$1.4 million to keep the nine state parks
-- including Eagle Creek Park -- open.
Under the governor\[CloseCurlyQuote]s plan, the earliest
the state parks could re-open is July 1.

Working to keep Eagle Creek Park
open is \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]one of my number one

priorites,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] state Rep. Michael Tate (R-
Decatur) said Wednesday.

Tate said he will introduce an am-
mendment to the governor\[CloseCurlyQuote]s tax plan
which would restore funding to the state
park

When questioned whether or not he
approved the Governor\[CloseCurlyQuote]s tax proposal,
Tate sidestepped the issue, Saying, by the
time the proposal reaches the House, it
will probably be amended \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]a hundred
times.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]

Tate will be meeting Thursday with
officials from both the governor\[CloseCurlyQuote]s office
and the DOC as well as a delegation from
Findlay which has expressed an interest
in taking over the operation of the state
