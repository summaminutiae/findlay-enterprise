Last full day

Findlay Grade School students took advantage of nice weather on their last full
day of school to give the equipment on the playground a good workout. For
many of the youngsters it was the last time until the fall that they would have the
opportunity to play with their classmates. Tuesday was the last full day of classes
for Findlay students. Students will return to school today (Friday) for one hour to

pick up their report cards -- then its home for the rest of the summer! High
school graduation was set for Thursday night and junior high school graduation
will be tonight (Friday). Some of the youngsters were sad that school was en-
ding, but the great majority of them were very, very happy that summer
vacation was finally here.
