High water

Earlier this spring with a lack of winter snows, it looked like Lake Shelbyville exactly normal -- the main road to the boat slips is under water and has been for

High water may favor fish hatch

the Lake Shellbyville Dam are keeping a
cautious eye on the lake\[CloseCurlyQuote]s water level,

level in Lake Shelbyville to 611.06 feet,
Thursday -- could result in an excellent
spawn for the sunfish species inhabiting
ake Shelbyville.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Usually high-water years produce a
better spawn,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Don Dufford, district
fishery biologist, said. When the lake

begun their spawning season -- spawn
first, Dufford said, followed closely by
the white crappie. Both the black and
white crappie spawn over a period of a
month, he said, depositing eggs which
take five to seven days to hatch.

The largemouth bass follow a similar
spawning procedure, he said, beginning
and ending their spawning season a little

later than the crappie.

From now until the first week in June,
Dufford said, the majority of sunfish
spawning will occur.

Dufford cited many factors in deter-
mining the yield of the sunfish\[CloseCurlyQuote]s spawn.
Some of the factors include the tem-
perature and clarity of the water and the
food supply.

The colder the water temperature,
Dufford said, the longer it takes the
sunfish eggs to hatch. Water tran-
slucence also affects the size of the
spawn. When the lake water is turgid,
Dufford said, the sunfish tend to deposit
their eggs nearer to the surface of the
water, thus making the eggs more
susceptible to exposure should the lake\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
water level fall off suddenly. :

Although there are many factors which
affect the yield of sunfish\[CloseCurlyQuote]s spawn,
Dufford said the main consideration this
year is the water level at Lake
Shelbyville

If the water level remains high, or does
not go down drastically between now and
the end of June, Dufford said the chances
for a productive spawn are good.

Ted Stork, assistant professional
scientist at the Illinois Natural History
Survey, echoed Dufford\[CloseCurlyQuote]s sentiments,
saying that the high water, unless it is
quickly released, may ~ actually
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]enhance the sunfish spawn.

Stork said the sunfish nests could be
exposed to wave and wind damage, if the
water level in Lake Shelbyville was to
fall off quickly.

The waterline of Lake Shelbyville is
still rising, James Butery, chief of water
control management at the St. Louis
district of the Corp of Engineers, said.

Presently, Butery said, water is en-
tering Lake Shelbyville at the rate of 1800

ic feet per second (CFS), while 1000
