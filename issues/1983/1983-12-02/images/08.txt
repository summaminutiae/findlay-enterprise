the Water Survey.

A storm is termed severe when a
location in Illinois receives six or more
inches of snow in 48 hours or when there
is damaging ice over at least 5,000 square
miles, said Stanley Changnon Jr., chief
of the Water Survey.

Changnon said the model shows the
typical severe winter storm moves from
west-southwest to east-northeast across
the state. On the average, it begins about
1] a.m. and continues at any point for a
little over 14 hours. The heavy snow area
of six inches or more is found about 75 to
100 miles north of the surface low
pressure center causing the storm.

Sleet and freezing rain often ac- i
company the severe snowstorm. The i

center of the freezing rain area is located
about 50 miles south of the six inch snow
area and an area of sleet may overlap
both the snow and the ice area.

IT IS NOT UNCOMMON for one
location to experience both rain and sleet
during the storm. In the average storm,
the freezing rain covers an area of about
8,400 square miles.

The weather condition most likely to
produce the pattern of snow, sleet and
freezing rain depicted by the model is a
low pressure system developing in
Colorado that moves southeast but then
turns northeast up the Ohio River Valley,
Changnon said. Fortunately, he notes,
only a small percentage of lows that
develop in Colorado each winter produce
a severe winter storm in Illinois.

The study of severe winter storms also
revealed there are certain days with a
relatively high incidence of storms.
There are two chances in ten that a
severe winter storm will occur
somewhere in Illinois Dec. 24, 25 or 26
and March 2 or 3.

Steve Hilberg, meteorologist at the
Water Survey said a severe winter storm
is most likely to hit during the month of
January. \[OpenCurlyQuote]There is a 70 percent chance
for one or more storms somewhere in the
state that month,\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] he said.

The part of the state most likely to
experience a severe winter snowstorm is
an area north of a line from Quincy to
Chicago. Ice storms are most likely
across central Illinois. However, in the
past several winters both central and
southern Illinois have experienced as
many severe winter storms as the nor-
thern portions of the state.

to vehicles from accidents caused by
slick roads and poor visibility. The
weight of excessive snow can damage
roofs of buildings.

Heavy snow combined with high winds
causes stoppages or serious delays in all
transportation systems, and these in turn
affect personal travel, business activities
and deliveries of goods and services
including food and medical care.
