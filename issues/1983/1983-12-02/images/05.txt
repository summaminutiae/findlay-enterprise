A 125 lb. dalmation has been donated to the Findlay Fire Protection District for
the new fire station. The dog doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t bark when alarms go off, nor does he chase
fire trucks -- he\[CloseCurlyQuote]s made of cement. The dalmation was donated by Mr. and Mrs.
Morris Hubbartt, owners of the Road Runner Shop east of Pana on Route 16.
Kathy Hubbartt (right) was on hand to donate the dog to Findlay fire personnel
Nov. 17. She was joined by trustee Ben Dawdy and fire chief Jim Chance. The
whole Hubbartt family works in the shop painting and preparing items for sale
such as Christmas decorations, deers, horses, pigs, fountains and bird baths.
