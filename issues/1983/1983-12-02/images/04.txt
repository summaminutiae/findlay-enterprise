Findlay youngsters -- usually bemoaning the fact there is no place to go or
nothing to do in town -- were entertained Saturday afternoon and evening. The
Findlay Jaycettes sponsored films -- in the afternoon for younger children, and
in the evening for teenagers -- at the fire station. The films were a success for
everyone.
