done

Well, this is a week after \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Day
After,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and although I was too cowardly
to watch it, I think quite a bit about
nuclear war. I'd just like to see the heads
of nations be able to sit down and
negotiate. Missles are poor weapons to
use for negotiations. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a no win
situation for all of us.

How did your Thanksgiving Day go? I
had a really good time visiting, but I felt
like the proverbial stuffed turkey. I just
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know why I never learn to stop
eating before I get that feeling. I hope the
rest of you were smarter than I was.

I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m writing this on Monday, Nov. 28
and I saw some snowflakes for sure. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve
been told there had been some earlier,
but I didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t see them. I shudder when I
hear people say they'd like to see about
12 inches of snow. I wish it could snow on
their turf and stay from mine. Big snows
just make me hanker to be in the Sun-

Shine State. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d rather be down there in
the warm sunshine and just see the snow
on television newscasts.

I mentioned a week or so ago in this
column that my dog\[CloseCurlyQuote]s been trying to get
me up at around 3 a.m. Well, I guess I
have one person in town who worries
about my sleeping habits. At 3 a.m.
someone called to ask me if my dog got
me out of bed. The dog didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t, but the
telephone did. Really it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s nice to hav
someone worry about you so much that
they stay up until 3 a.m. to learn if your
dog\[CloseCurlyQuote]s behaving or not. Thanks Pal. |
think I've talked to you in the early
morning hours before.

I just barely stopped in time for the
new stop sign when I was coming home
from Bethany Friday. Habits get pretty
strong, and at the time I wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t thinking
about the signs being up yet. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a
strange place to stop, and I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m sure it will
take some of us a while to get used to it.
I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m gonna try hard to remember \[CloseCurlyQuote]cause I
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t wanna get a ticket. I need my
money for other things. I can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t give

New center

needs support

Dear Findlians:

We would just like to let you know what
we are thinking about and planning for in
the work for the Community Center.

We are planning to have a few rules
and guidelines for the center to be voted
on at the next meeting at 7 p.m. Tuesday,
Dec. 6. We want you to be present.

I think you would all like to know what
to plan for in the future. I also think you
will all want to be a part of the activities.
If you are all in attendance this will show
you are interested.

Also, you may be asked to serve on a
taskforce or committee to see that a
particular task if accomplished at the
center.

We have a lot of work that needs to be
finished before the building is ready for
use. Things like painting, rest rooms
fixed, floors finished, appliances in-
Stalled, heating, tables and chairs

and some plumbing, elec-
trical and carpenter work donated.

If you are willing to donate to this
cause, give your name and telephone
number on a piece of paper to any officer
and state what you are willing to donate,
by the meeting Dec. 6.

The center needs your help in order to
complete the task that has been started.
We are counting on your. You can depend
on us.

defends Reagan

Letter to the Editor:

I am stationed in Korea. I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t really
know what the people of the great United
States think about President Reagan. |I
read how the people don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t like the
Marines being in Lebanon because they
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t serve a purpose. I also hear about
the people rioting because Reagan
rescued (invaded) Grenada.

I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t understnad the people at home.
I can see a little bit why we shouldn't be
in Lebanon because we are being tested
on. Then Reagan starts testing like in
Grenada.

People hate Reagan because he is in a
way killing the men of the United States.
I mean \[OpenCurlyQuote]men\[CloseCurlyQuote] because we are not boys
(like people think).

Reagan is doing his part. Everybody
took Reagan's trip to Japan and South
Korea in view. I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know about Japan,
but in Korea he put his life into the hands
of the enemy. He is the only president
that has gone into the DMZ and let the
enemy see his face. I suppose people hate
Reagan for that too because if he would
have been shot the big balloon would
have went.

I bet nobody thought that while he was
there they were enjoying their freedom.
The people voted for Reagan for
president, so why don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you support hi
and his actions as president.

I think people should support the
defense of our country or maybe there
won't be any country to defend.
