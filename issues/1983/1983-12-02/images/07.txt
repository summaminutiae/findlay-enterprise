In memoriam __

TROY MASSEY
Troy Massey has now made his debut in
heaven
As we gather to pay our last farewell, my
brethren

He was a man among men, as I see his life,
And he leaves mourning many friends, family
and wife.

Findlay has lost a perfect example
of goodwill toward men. I grapple

for words to express my heart
About this dear man who is a treasured part

Of our family, whom we hold in highest
esteem.

Troy loved people. Love was the theme

Of his life. From morning \[OpenCurlyQuote]til night

He administered goodwill. If there was ever a

plight |
From his fellowman, he'd race to their
rescue,

And with all his might their interest he'd

pursue.

Oh yes, he made a mistake or two every now
and then.
But you point out someone who's never, and I'll
kiss your foot my friend.

He was always sharing what he had the most
of:

always his love.
Today old acquaintances I'm sure he's
i é

renewing
Beyond the portals of glory where God himself is

wooing

him; making him welcome to eternity
where we'll meet him someday when we too are
free

From our pilgrimage here on this earth laden
with sin.
My life has been enriched by knowing Troy
Massey, my friend.

In loving memory of Kenneth
Carson who died December 1980.

If all the world was ours to give
We would give it yes and more

To see his smiling face again
Come shining through the door.

Friends may think we have forgotten
When at times they see us smile

Little do they know the heartaches
Our smiles hide all the while

More and more we miss him -
Tho some may think the wounds

Are healed.
But little do they know

Concealed.
Sadly missed by,
Wile
