Band Boosters re organize

New officers were elected and fund
raising activities discussed at a
reorganizational meeting of the Findlay
Band Boosters Nov. 22.

Dee Ann Winings was elected president
of the group. Other new officers are
Nedra Hash, vice president; Linda

Findlay music director Fritz Wheeler
reported that the Band Festival held
Nov. 8 at Findlay High School had 130
students participating representing eight
area high schools.

A list of upcoming music events in-
volving the high school chorus and the
grade school, junior high school and high
school band students was given by
. These include the annual
Christmas concert Dec. 18, a choral
festival Feb. 9, the annual high school
musical Feb. 11, the Illinois State High
School Solo and Ensemble Contest March
3, the Junior High School Band Contest
sometime in March and the High School

were suggested by Band Boosters in-
cluding a drawing, a coat check at
basketball games, band booster stickers,

a dance fund raiser and selling coffee at
basketball games. Chairmen were ap-
pointed to look into the feasibility of each
project.

Wheeler presented a check for $100
from the Findlay American Legion Post
and Legion Auxiliary Unit to the Findlay
Band Boosters and band members in
appreciation for the help the band has
given to the two local organizations for
help with Legion and Auxiliary projects.
The donations will be use to help pur-
chase new uniforms.

Five new uniforms have been ordered
for the students who do not. have
uniforms this year. The cost of the
uniforms will be $1,240. More uniforms
will have to be ordered for the next year
for the students who will be into
junior high. Only four seniors will be
graduating from the band at the end of
the school year, so several money
making projects will have to be held to
purchase new uniforms for next year,
band boosters learned.

The popcorn selling project has almost
reached the break even point. The
popcorn that is left to sell will realize a
profit of $1,000, so there is still a lot of
popcorn left to sell. Band members or

alumnimum risers for the chorus. The
old plywood risers are being wobbly and
worn out.

The profits from the sale of popcorn
will be used to purchase new uniforms
and to start a fund to help repair the old

events, plays, wehie ha ate that are
held in the gym.

The Findlay Band Boosters will hold a
membership drive in the near future to
increase their ranks. Members need not
be parents of band or chorus students. All
Findlay area residents who are in-
terested in seeing the band and chorus
programs continue and grow are urged J
to join.

will be held at 7:30 p.m. Jan. 10.

Fund started for Ashli Bun ch

ny Cae ey

A fund has been started at the Bank of
Findlay for a four month old Findlay
baby suffering from a kidney disease.

Ashli Darlene Bunch, four month old
daughter of Brent and Kathi (Storey)
Bunch of Findlay, is presently a patient
in St. John\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Hospital in Springfield for
the third time. She has also been a
patient at St. Mary\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Hospital in Decatur
for extended lengths of time.

Ashli was born with an inherited
disease known as polycystic kidneys. As
a result of her illness and extended
hospitalization, her parents have in-
curred large medical bills. They have no

According to Ashli\[CloseCurlyQuote]s grandmother,
Mrs. Carol Butler, one hospital stay for
one week of testing cost the couple
$30,000. She was a patient in the pediatric
high risk intensive care unit and St.
John\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Hospital absorbed part of the bill.

Mrs. Butler said that pediatric
nephologists said that a kidney tran-
splant might be done when Ashli reaches
40 pounds, which might be when she
reaches the age of four. Until that time

5"" may be many more hospital stays.

Complications from Ashli\[CloseCurlyQuote]s illness
have left her with heart damage and a

heart murmur. At one time, she was

taken to the hospital with her blood
pressure at 230.

Ashli\[CloseCurlyQuote]s father has been unemployed for
one year. Because her mother, Kathi,
receives one-third the income from a
small farm, she is unable to get help
from Crippled Children, Illinois State Aid
and the Kidney Foundation. Her income
from the farm figures less than $5,000 per
year.

So, as Mrs. Butler pointed out, there is
no money for the astronomical hospital
bills that keep building up.

The Kum Join Us Class of the Findlay
United Methodist Church has established
The Ashli Bunch Fund at the Bank of
Findlay to accept donations to help the
young family. Their priority right now is
to help purchase medicine. Ashli\[CloseCurlyQuote]s ex-
pensive medicine is now constantly
changing as the doctors try to find
something more helpful for her con-
dition.

Make preparations for winter now

The last thing that anyone wants to
hear about after a relatively mild fall is
winter and the storms that usually ac-
company the coldest season of the year.
The Illinois State oe ee 4
division of the Department of Energy
and Natural Resources (ENR) has been
reviewing its studies of winter storms
and their effect on the state in an-
ticipation of Winter Storm Preparedness
Week, Nov. 27-Dec. 3.

Severe winter storms produce more
total damage in Illinois that any other
form of short-term severe weather

events including tornadoes,
hail, says the Water Survey.

tornadoes, lightning and

annual average has been 11 storms per
winter.
DURING THE AVERAGE severe

winter snowstorm in Illinois 15 percent of

the state, or 7,800 square miles, receives
six inches or more of snow. More than

half the state is covered by one inch or

more of snow, but less that three percent
of the storm area may receive 12 or more
inches of snow.

Once again, two Findlay civic

soring the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Operation Santa Claus\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]
project which last year helped to provide
food and gifts to the families of almost 30
children.

A benefit dance will be held tonight
(Friday) from 7:30 to 10:30 p.m. at the
Findlay High School gym. All proceeds
will go to purchase food and toys for the
Operation Santa Claus project.

does not plan to attend but would like to
contribute can send their donations to the
Findlay Junior Woman\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Club or the
Findlay Jaycees.

The ee oe Santa Claus\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] project
was started several years ago
by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as a
countywide project. When the Corps
gave the project up, the Findlay Junior
Woman\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Club took over the project for
the Findlay area. For the past two years,
the Findlay Jaycees have been actively
involved in helping with the project.

In addition to the dance, the
organizations are conducting a drive for
good used toys, canned goods and funds.
Anyone with any good used toys or new
toys or canned goods can drop the con-
tributions off at any of the Findlay
churches -- boxes have been installed in
the basements -- or to the homes of
Denise Dever or Vicki Oldham.
