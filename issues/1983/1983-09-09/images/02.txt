Me Thinks 1, pain. Briney

I heard Dick Durbin, U.S.
Congressman, state last week that the
country needs to cut out waste more than
it has yet. As an example he told about
the legs of a small stool in the cockpit of
an AWACS radar plane that needed a
plastic cap on the legs. One day a crew
chief noticed the caps were missing and
requisitioned replacements. He ordered
the Pentagon\[CloseCurlyQuote]s purchasing system to
replace them. The caps cost $1,118.26
each. Boeing Aircraft should no longer be
patronized by the government. Plastic
Caps just ain\[CloseCurlyQuote]t worth that amount of
money. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll bet they laughed all the way
to the bank that time. I shudder to think
how long I would have to work to make
enough money to purchase one stinking
little plastic cap. Is that greed or is that
greed on the part of Boeing? Perhaps the
country needs to acquire some new

purchasing agents.

Two hundred and sixty nine people lost
their lives needlessly when the Russians
shot down a plane. A few marines have
died needlessly because they were sent to
a dangerous place. As long as we're hot
involved in a war I deem it senseless to
lose even one Marine. As I understand it
they were not there for combat. Why
were they there? Just to provide human
targets? It seems the Russians aren\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
doing much to better relations between
our country and theirs. I have no com-
ment about what should be done to
retaliate for the loss of a plane and 269
lives. I do hope it doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t end up being
another embargo. That would only cause
more problems like it did before. For one
thing it would put a lot of people out of
work, and there\[CloseCurlyQuote]s already plenty of that.
If they put an embargo on grain sales it
will all but ruin the American farmer,
and we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll only be hurting the farmers and
our nation. I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t want to see another
embargo on pipeline laying equipment
either. I want Caterpillar and other
manufacturers to have contracts so they
Can put people back to work.

Speaking of factories, I abhore the fact
that some of them are going to use robots
instead of human labor. They\[CloseCurlyQuote]re biting
off their noses to spite their faces. If
American people don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t work they can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
buy, and robots don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t spend money or
pay taxes. They don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t buy tires either.

Findlay days was FUN! I think every
year it gets bigger and better. I really
enjoyed two of the added attractions this
year. The mud wrestling by some very
brave females and the judging of male

legs. After a few threatening looks from
a few people I made a premature exit
from the mud wrestling pit. I sneaked
down the alley and out of sight. I knew
that if I didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t make a fast get away I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d
be in that slimy mud. I admire those who
were willing to get in the mud and
wrestle, but I hate mud. I can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t even
stand to walk barefoot around it or get it
between my toes. And besides I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m too old
for that. I should have some good pic-
tures of that event, but I didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t take them
where I really should have. That was too
dangerous. Besides the wrestlers a lot of
spectators who never dreamed of getting
near the mud ended up in it. Harry Clark
from Blue Mound looked really neat in
his fireman\[CloseCurlyQuote]s uniform until somebody
gave him a toss into the slime. You
should have seen him then. There was no
way to tell he was wearing a fireman\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
uniform. I can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t believe it\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll ever be clean
again. The Blue Mound Fire Department
will probably have to spring for a new
uniform. Then there were those guys
with the legs. Now I always liked long
legs, but Charlotte Newman, Gloria
Livergood and legs chairman, Annie Lee,
must agree they all like short legs. They
voted for Bill Walters as having the
shortest legs, then also voted he had the
best overall legs and presented him with
two ribbons and a garter that they put in
place for him. He wore it proudly. I guess
if I was voted as having the best legs in
town I would too.

The crowd was the biggest we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve had
yet, and I think if posters were put up in
more towns, it would be bigger yet.

I bought a pie at a food auction, and
Bill Walters \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The mayor
spent ten dollars\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] like that was the first
ten bucks I ever parted with.
