The Bank of Findlay would like to introduce you to a new sight, soon to
become familiar. Our new logo.

We feel as though it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s very important for you to be able to identify our logo
and US, and what we both stand for.

On our logo, the two arrows stand for movement, both forward and up-
ward. The line below and behind symbolize our stability. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s an up and on sym-
bol, and it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s something we're proud of because we feel it represents us.

You see, for many years, banks have been steeped in tradition, and are
afraid to change. Not the Bank of Findlay. We want to be ahead of the crowd,
not in it.

When you think about it, why would a person who is as progressive as you
are want to bank with an organization that is afraid of the future and is unwilling
to stay ahead, when you can bank with a winner. The Bank of Findlay. An
organization that is willing to give what it takes to stay ahead and on top of an
ever changing industry to provide you with the best possible service.

That\[CloseCurlyQuote]s more than a bunch of words, that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s our committment. Simply put,
\[OpenCurlyQuote]'To be the Best.\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]

The Bank of Findlay, where great things happen to great people.
