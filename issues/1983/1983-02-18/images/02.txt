I recently read an article that said if
the United States had all of the money
owned us we could walk in gold shoes on
streets of gold. Now I can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t prove that,
and I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know where the writer got his
information, but it's believable to me.

Gas prices are up, but they\[CloseCurlyQuote]re not as
high here as they are in some surroun-

ag
know when there\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a fire. So I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t get
pictures of them. I wish the whistle could
be fixed and used. I think I said the same

thing two years and received a letter

from Bill Rosine addressed to \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The
Mayor Who Wants to Blow the Whistle in
Findlay Again.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I came upon that letter
yesterday, and thought it might be of
interest to Methinks readers.

only on the noon hour or for a fire. Blow it
on anything such as village board
meetings, etc. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s time to wake up this
village. (It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s slept long enough), or you
are all doomed. In another part of the
letter he says utility bills are too high and
says it costs more to urinate the water
than to drink it. I agree with a part of this

here. If you don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t support your local
businesses we won't have them, and
without them we homeowners wouldn't
be able to sell our property. So we'd have
to stay in a ghost town. I.\[CloseCurlyQuote]s your town and
my town. Don't we have a responsibility
to make it the best town it can be? Bill
Rosine ended his letter with \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Action not
words are final.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] [ agree with that also..
Let\[CloseCurlyQuote]s show where are loyalties are. In our
home town or some other town?

How can we villagers make this town
better? There must be some people out
there with some great ideas. If you have
ideas let\[CloseCurlyQuote]s hear them in a letter to the
editor. Let\[CloseCurlyQuote]s do

enough.

I love this village. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d like to see it grow
and prosper. In less than ten years we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll
be celebrating our centennial. The town

homes here much earlier than that.

Did you read about Marsh Madness
in the Decatur paper. I did, and for some
reason the whole thing was upsetting to
me. In fact, I read it several times, and I

still can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t see any good in it. If some

basketball players were that unhappy
about playing basketball I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m sure they
had the option of quitting. But they chose

Sixth graders

search for title

This week and the next few weeks, the
Findlay Grade School sixth grade class
of Steve Baker is trying to name a moth.

Julie Livergood hatched a moth from a
cocoon and gave it to George Carter to
photograph and then turn it loose. Carter
is going to enter the photograph in the
Shelby County Town and Country Art
Show March 26 and 27.

Carter has asked the assistance of
Julie\[CloseCurlyQuote]s fellow students and anyone else
interested in picking a title for this
picture.
