An April 30 completion date for the
Findlay sewer project is \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]engraved in

Eberspacher told the Findlay village
board Monday night.

Several problems relating to the sewer
project were reviewed by the village
board, Eberspacher and engineer Lee
Sierkerka. The completion date was
given during a review of an agreement
the village made with contractor Hal
Harshman to complete the last phase of
the sewer project, the sewage treatment
plant. |

In Eberspacher\[CloseCurlyQuote]s update, he explained
proposed repairs to the tertiary filter at
the sewage treatment plant. These
repairs are holding up completion of the
project. Eberspacher said that he and
village trustee Dwight Riley had been
directed to work out the settlement with
Harshman to avoid a court suit. Such
court action would have been both costly
and time consumng.

In addition to repair work on the
damaged filter, the agreement calls for a
payment procedure and warranties.
Harshamn will warranty work on the
entire sewer plant for one year (this is
standard) and for five years on the
repaired tertiary filter.

Some concern was expressed about the
payment procedures by village treasurer
Joan Lucas who pointed out that only $28
was left in the sewer construction fund. A
transfer of funds from the gas fund has
already been made to make a payment to
another one of the contractors, Kieffer
Brothers Construction Co.

Another proposed payment to Kieffer,
as provided by a motion passed last
month, was tabled until a review of funds
could be made. Some of the funds can be
transferred from monies the village has
in certificates of deposit.

Funds from the Environmental
Protection Agency are being held up
because the Operations Manual has not
been approved. The engineers submitted
the manual to the EPA last fall. Other
funds will not be remitted to the village
for the project until the entire system is
completed, in operation and receives a
final inspection by the EPA.

IN OTHER ACTION, the board
reluctantly approved a request by
Sierkerka to apply to the EPA for ad-
ditional funds for engineering fees. This
is the third time that a request for ad-
ditional funds has been made.

Of the amount of $7,400 in additional
funds that Sierkerka requested, the
village will be responsible for 25 percent.

Sierkerka told the board that his firm,
Upchurch, Davidson and Assoc. had run
out of engineering funds for the Findlay
project at the end of January. The $7,400
was an estimate of how much it would
cost the firm to wrap up the project.

Unlike the contractors, the engineers

Eberspacher reported it was not 14
days since the final deadline was set up
for hooking up the system, and he was
ready to go to court to obtain the final
hookups or cut off water service, ef-
ee te eee

Utility supervisor Bill Rankin told the
board that there were still three or four
individuals not hooked on to the system.
If a home or business is not receiving
water at this time, they do not need to be
hooked up to the system. However, at
such time as the are hooked up for water,
a new sewer hook up will be necessary.

THREE PROBLEMS with the new
system were briefly reviewed by the
board, Kenny Sweeney reported a
problem he was having installing sewer
service to a building owned by Don
Johnson on Main Street.

After reviewing the problem with the
board, village trustee Dwight Riley
volunteered to help resolve the problem
and get the hookup installed as soon as
possible.

Eldon Gourley, local representative
for Country Companies, appeared before
the board on behalf of three claims made
against his insurance company by three
individuals that suffered damage to their
vehicles as a result of the sewer project.

County Companies has disallowed the
claims. George Carter, village trustee
and insurance commissioner, reported
that the claims were also disallowed by
the insurance company. Kieffer Brothers
Construction Co.\[CloseCurlyQuote]s insurance company
claimed the damages were the result of
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]an act of nature.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

The three claims total $259 and were
sustained by vehicles owned by Carter,
Jim Mounts and Joe Ikemire.

The total amount will be charged to
Kieffer Brothers and something will be
worked out, or the monies will be kept out
of the retainage that the village still has
outstanding against the construction

company.

The final problem that was reviewed
was some additional type of alarm at the
life station in the event of pump failure. A
failure of one of the pumps caused
sewage to back up into a basement
residence causing damage.

Sewer commissioner Ron McClain
looked into having the telephone com-
pany install a call system on four phones.
However, such a system would cost
$1,270. The board rejected this system
because of the high cost.

The matter was tabled; however,
village trustee Dave Thurber told the
board, \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]There\[CloseCurlyQuote]s far less expensive ways
to get what we want done,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] so a system
will be found in the event of another
pump failure.
