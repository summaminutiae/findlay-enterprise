Cable T.V. franchise awarded

Conflicts in a proposed cable television
ordinance were worked out between a
representative of the cable television
firm and the Findlay village attorney at
a meeting of the Findlay village board
Monday night.

As a result, the board approved the
ordinance and granted a franchise
agreement to First Rural Cable TV of
Decatur. The firm will begin site work
immediately and installation of the

Dale Schuerman told the board that the
basic system will include 10 channels and
two pay tiers, HBO and Cinemax. The
village will have no control over the cost
of the service; the company will charge
\[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]what the traffic will bear.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

However, the village will reap a three
percent charge from each customer for
the basic services. This will bring the
charge for basic service to $11 per
month. There will be an extra charge for
thepaytiers. .

Details of the agreement were worked
out with the cable television firm, village
attorney E.C. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Chris\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Eberspacher and
village trustee Dave Thurber.

Thurber was concerned about the
village not having any control over
programming. He told the board \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]they
(First Rural Cable) do not want the

village board of Findlay or anyone at all
to have discretion over channel selec-
tion.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]

First Rural Cable has systems in nine
Assumption and Moweaqua, and this is
their policy in all of these towns.
Schuerman explained that after the
payoff period (anticipated to be about
four or five years) that subscribers will
possibly have the option of adding ad-
ditional channels at an extra cost.

The said that these channels could
include religious programming, chan-
nels involved with the arts and additional
sports. Their reason for not adding the
addtional channels at first is cost. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We
have to get approval from our bank to
justify the expense,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he stated.

Schuermon told the board that the first
customers could be brought on line
during the summer, but they could run
into problems. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We ran into trouble in
Assumption and that caused some
delay.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

The firm will be installing Findlay\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
cable television system at the same time
that a system is installed in Bethany. The
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]head in,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] where a dish and tower to
receive sattelite transmissions, will be
located somewhere between the two
villages.

Liquor ordinance proposed

The Findlay village board directed
attorney E.C. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Chris\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Eberspacher to
prepare a liquor ordinance at Monday
night\[CloseCurlyQuote]s meeting.

Village Trustee Larry Rodman
brought the proposal before the board
when he said, \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]we ought to be discussing
liquor licenses.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He said he was
responding to public questions about
what type of business estalishements
would be allowed to sell liquor in the
event the proposed wet-iry referendum
is successful.

The question of whether to allow liquor
sales in Findlay will be placed before
Findlay voters in the April 12 general
election. A similar referendum failed by
a small margin a few years back.

Rodman said he had talked with
several residents concerned about

people would know\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] what they are voting
on, he stated.

Other board members agreed with

The ordinance will be in effect only if
the question of liquor sales in Findlay is
approved. Under terms of the ordinance,
the board decided to allow one liquor
license for package liquor sales; two
liquor licenses for sales of beer and wine
only; one retail liquor sales with food (a
restaurant) and two liquor licenses for
private clubs.

The board could approve the ordinance
at the next regular meeting, March. 21.
