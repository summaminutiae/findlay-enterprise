Falcons clip Niantic
then lose to Maroa

Findlay entertained the Niantic-
Harristown Indians on Friday, Feb. 11
and came away with an important
Meridian Conference victory by a score
of 72-67.

The win put the Falcons at the top of
the conference standings with an #1
record.

Unfortunately, Findlay\[CloseCurlyQuote]s stay at the
top was a short one. The Falcons lost to
pre-season favorite Maroa-F orsyth 67-54
in a makeup game played at Findlay on
Monday, Feb. 14. The win put Maroa\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
Trojans on top with an 8-1 record.

Findlay joins Assumption, Blue Mound
and Stonington in a scramble for second
place. All those teams have lost two
conference games. Maroa-Forsyth
clinched at least a share of the title on
Tuesday by defeating Moweaqua.

The Falcons could still conceivably win
a share of the title, but only if they win
over Stonington Friday and Bethany can
beat Maroa-F orsyth.

Against Niantic, the Falcons rolled to
early leads of as much as 13 points before
Niantic pulled back to within two points
at halftime.

The game remained close the rest of
the way but the Falcons never
relinquished the lead and pulled away in
the fourth quarter to gain the 72-67 win.

The Falcons were led in scoring by
Gary Grant who tallied 24 points. Bob
Kellow added 19 points to the total. The
Falcons played without the services of
Mike Berg who had an injury.

Bob Kellow led the Falcons effort
against Maroa with 17 points. Mike Berg
returned to action and scored nine points.

The Falcons started well enough and
held a 29-28 halftime lead over the
Trojans. Maroa was paced by 6\[CloseCurlyQuote]6\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Rick
James who scored 16 points and blocked
several Falcon shot attempts. Good ball

THE FINDLAY ENTERPRISE--FINDLAY, ILLINOIS 62534

handling by Brock Saladin helped Maroa
roll up the lead to the final margin.

The Falcons were at a size disad-
vantage in the game and when Maroa
finally took the lead in the third quarter it
was very difficult to catch up.

The Falcon junior varsity picked up
two more wins in games with Niantic and
Maroa. The Niantic contest was close all
the way with Findlay coming out on top
by a score of 70-68.

Doug Newman led Findlay\[CloseCurlyQuote]s scoring

with 20 points. Brett Cummins and Jeff .

Brooks added 17 and 15 respectively. The
Falcons were without Mike Sthrol, who
was ill.

The JV\[CloseCurlyQuote]s handled Maroa\[CloseCurlyQuote]s 78-61 with
balanced scoring. Strohl, Cummins,
Brooks and Newman had 16, 15, and 15
points respectively to lead the way.

Falcons top Windsor
for sweet revenge

travelled to Windsor and got some sweet
revenge for a 59-58 loss early in the
season. This time around, the Falcons

A 20-8 Findlay scoring edge in the third
quarter was the difference as it in-
creased the Falcon\[CloseCurlyQuote]s 34-25 halftime lead
and put the game away.

Bob Kellow led the Falcons with 17
points. Jody Getz added 15, Gary Grant
13, and Charles Watkins 12. Findlay\[CloseCurlyQuote]s

Two Falcons battle for the ball Friday night as Findlay downed Niantic-
Harristown. The victory put Findlay at the top of the Meridian Conference
standings. A subsequent loss to Maroa-Forsyth on Monday night put the Falcons
in a four way tie for second place. There is still a possibility that the Falcons can
clinch a share of title. The final home game of the season will be played tonight
(Friday) against Stonington.
