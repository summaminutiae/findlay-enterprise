OPTOMETRIST

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]A\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] For Eye Help

About 95% of all children\[CloseCurlyQuote]s eye

problems can be corrected today -

either in whole or in part. That's
a \[OpenCurlyQuote]straight A\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] in anyone\[CloseCurlyQuote]s book.
The most common

are those affecting the ability to
see clearly-and sharply. Myopia
(nearsightedness) causes near
objects to be seen more clearly
than objects at a distance. With
hyperopia (far sightedness) ob-
jects are seen more clearly at a
distance, but close-up objects are
sometimes blurred and difficult
to bring into focus. Astigmatism
can cause objects to be distorted
and will not allow all portions of
an object to be seen in focus at
one time. These are relatively
to identify through an eye

examination and to correct if
needed.

Unfortunately, you probably
won't hear about these problems
from children. If they see chalk-
boards or book pages as blurs,
they\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll assume everyone does.
Since 80% of learning is through
vision, give your child a head
start with an eye examination
BEFORE entering school. That
will give you an \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]A\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] for effort
whether your child\[CloseCurlyQuote]s vision needs
help or not.-
