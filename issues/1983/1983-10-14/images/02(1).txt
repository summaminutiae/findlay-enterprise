Bloomington to a football game it was
sunny and warm. Something happened
on the way, and by the time I got there I
nearly froze to death. The weather

had said it would rain early Saturday

afternoon. Well, I didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t see the sun all

My sister, Corma Cox from Farina,
pulled a funny one last week. She had an
insurance form to fill out, so having a
blank mind when filling out insurance
papers she took it to her agent and asked
if he would fill it out. She slammed it
down on his desk and said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know
one thing about filling out these forms.
You'll have to help me.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The funny part
was the only questions on this one that
needed to be filled out were, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What
relation are you to the policy holder,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
and the tough answer was, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]spouse.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
The other two questions were her age and
whether or not she was male or female.

She was embarrassed, the agent was
very gracious about the whole thing.
Even though he chuckled a bit.

From the Enterprise of Oct. 3, 1958
SET THE FARMER FREE!

In a lashing editorial on the folly of our
government\[CloseCurlyQuote]s agricultural policies,
Publisher Tom Anderson of Farm and
Ranch writes. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Government control will
work only in heaven where they don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
need it or in Hell where they already
have it. Let\[CloseCurlyQuote]s get the government out!
Let\[CloseCurlyQuote]s set the farmer free!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

It is argued, of course, that govern-
ment supports and controls are essential
to the very existence of farming, and that
chaos would reign if they were
or even materially reduced in size and
scope. But those arguments have a
mighty tenuous base so far as fact is
concerned. All the evidence indicates
that the surplus problem has been the
direct and inevitable result of long
established government policy. Instead
of producing to meet public demand,
farmers produce to meet a political
condition

For example, Dr. Herrell De Graff of
Cornell, who is one of the most highly
regarded agricultural economists in the
country, has said this, \[OpenCurlyQuote]Over the past 35
years, during which so called surpluses
have been almost chronic, a modest 2
percent increase in livestock could have

eaten up all of the surpluses. This would
have happened had agriculture been
free.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Other agricultural economists are
now emphasizing the need for expanding
animal agricultural -- which in-
cidentally, is free market agriculture.

Meat animals convert grains into foods
which practically everyone wants, needs
and likes. It would certainly seem high
time the government thought in terms of
putting crops to productive use -- instead
of into storage. That will be done if we set
the farmer free to produce what con-
sumers will buy.

What does the farmer of today think of
this article? How much has changed in
the past 25 years? Does the farmer still
think the government is on his back, and
would he like to be set free? Not being a
farmer I would like to know how the
farmer of this day agrees or disagrees
with these facts stated 25 years ago. How
much has farming changed in the past
quarter of a century? If some one wishes
to reply to these questions we'd print his
or her letter to the editor. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d be in-
terested in the answers. Being a farming
community we should have a lot of an-
swers. There\[CloseCurlyQuote]s not much more of interest
in our village than agriculture.

If you haven\[CloseCurlyQuote]t seen the new sewer plant
ask one of the village board members or
employees to give you a tour of it. In spite
of all the problems it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s quite a neat and
interesting place.

Connie and I went metal detecting
Friday at Forest Park in Shelbyville. It
costs $10 to get a permit. We hunted all
day and found lots of rusty nails and
screws and one measly 1977 penny. Our
time wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t worth much, but we had fun
anyway.
