Me Tinks 1 rasite viny

James Watt has a big mouth. He ad-
mits that his statement about his staff
having two negros, two women and a

cripple was unfortunate. I say it was
unforgiveable. In my opinion, he\[CloseCurlyQuote]s the
cripple -- like in between the ears

in a product I think calls at 8 or 9 p.m.
would turn me off. This week I received a
call about making an early pledge to the
Cerebral Palsy Foundation. She said
their drive starts in January, but they
wanted to do some work ahead of time.
She turned me off too. If I wanted to
make a pledge I'd do it at the time of
their annual drive. I love to have family
and friends call anytime, but I could do
without the others.

I saw part of the high school girls\[CloseCurlyQuote]
volleyball games Wednesday night. They
. looked pretty good to me. As usual I had
to ask those sitting around me what was
going on. I wish I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d learned more about
sports.

I ate out about every day or night for a
week to celebrate my birthday and en-
joyed every bit of it. The enjoyment
ceased for a moment when my doctor
expressed his displeasure at my gaining
three pounds. Oh well, it was fun while it
lasted. Maybe next year I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll lose a few
pounds before my birthday so I can eat
hearty when I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m taken out, but I
seriously doubt it. I think a lot about
losing weight, but that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s about as far as it
goes. I got no will power.

As of Saturday morning the new sewer
plant was in operation, and all was well
with it. Thank goodness! I thought for
awhile we'd never see it in operation. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll
enjoy some village board meetings that
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t devote so much time to talking
about sewers. I still don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know much
about sewers but more than I did a few
years ago.

I heard Vangie Love tell a funny story
about a mortician who spends most of the
summer at Fox Harbor. He hired a 25
year old man to help him pick up a body.
The mortician had a dinner engagement,
so he asked the man if he would stay at

the funeral home for a couple of hours.
When the mortician returned he found
the man sitting almost stiff in a chair,
afraid to move and with a greenish
colored complexion. He greeted the
mortician with, \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]There\[CloseCurlyQuote]s somebody in
there (where the body was). The mor-

_tician assured him that was impossible

because all the doors were locked, and
the man replied he\[CloseCurlyQuote]d heard the toilet in
there flush three times. The mystery was
solved when the mortician explained that
there was a urinal in there that
automatically flushed every half hour.
Katy Orr brought me the following:
You Know It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Going To Be A Bad Day
When: :

eYou wake up face down on the
pavement.

You call suicide prevention, and they
put you on hold.

¢You put your bra on backwards, and it
fits better.

eYou see a 60 minutes news team
waiting in your office.

*Your birthday cake collapses from
the weight of the candles.

eYour son tells you he wished Anita
Bryant would mind her own business.

*You want to put on the clothes you
wore home from last night\[CloseCurlyQuote]s party -- and
there aren\[CloseCurlyQuote]t any.

*You turn on the news, and they\[CloseCurlyQuote]re
showing emergency routes out of the
city

eYour twin sister forgets your bir-
thday.

*You wake up to discover that your
waterbed broke, and then realize you
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have a waterbed.

eYour horn goes off accidentally and
remains stuck as you follow a group of
Hell\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Angels on the freeway.

¢Your wife wakes up feeling amorous
and you have a headache! !!!
