several union
representatives appeared before the
board to object to two of the contractors
-- Adams Landscaping and Harshman.

Despite the 18 month delay in design
completion and bid letting, bids came in
within range of what the engineers had

the construction industry.

some of the project wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t.

Kieffer Brothers completed its portion
of the project, Division A, during the
summer of 1982. Division A was just a
few months behind schedule.

For a while, when engineer Leon
Sierkerka was giving reports to the
village bard on the project, it looked as
if there would be no problems with
completing Division C, the sewage
treatment plant, and the entire project

That was when a problem arose with
the tertiary filter system at the sewer
plant. The plant was essentially com-

damage to the tertiary filter.

worked with the contractor, Harshman,
Plumbing, Heating & Electrical, the
engineers and the manufacturer and
supplier of the tank to solve the problem
and get the necessary parts to complete
the repairs. |

board might have to go to court, but

board that the project would be com-

The whole thing is under warranty for

Meanwhile, the village board will
receive the final change order and pay
estimate for the project at the next
regular meeting, Oct. 10. This may be the
last meeting for a long time when the
sewer project will come up for
discussion.

After ten years, it hardly seems
possible that it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s finally done.
