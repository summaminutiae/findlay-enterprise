He says the
He also stated that even if it did show a
profit \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]this plan has too many
drawbacks. Lake Shelbyville was built

taxation, and it might seem to us that we
indeed have sacrificed to have a lake.

They expect us to spend more than we

can afford to build roads and furnish -

other essentials, like ambulance service.
In some instances tourists have needed
ambulance services, but after their
emergency ended they weren\[CloseCurlyQuote]t anxious
to pay the bill.

As I have said before I like the lake
okay, but I think our little community
might have been better off just having
the little river flowing quietly along.

Another point the writer makes is
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]that if tourism drops, so will local sales
tax and gasoline tax receipts.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Well, I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m
sure you know as well as I do that we\[CloseCurlyQuote]re
not getting rich off the tourists. We\[CloseCurlyQuote]re
just a town the tourists must necessarily
drive through to reach their destination.
Very few stop here to buy anything. The
grocery stores and gas stations might
gain a bit, but very little according to the
number of people who use our roads to

pass through.

It seems we were promised much more
than we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve yet received from lake
traffic. The only interest the Decatur
Herald and Review and the Corps of
Engineers have in the lake is to keep it all
free and clear for tourists. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s been
evident for years that the Corps could
care less about our opinions, and that
seems to be the echo of the Decatur H.
and R. They are interested in the fact
that the area once partially developed

would not be as attractive to the tourists -

who go to Lake Shelbyville to get away
other developments. Of course that does
not include us. They could care less what

it means to us. They stated that, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Once

the shoreline is pockmarked with private

the lake itself will be of

less interest to hikers, hunters, boaters
swimmers.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

That means the outsiders who come in.
We've always had a good area for hiking

_and the recreation areas. That may have

been one reason for their stance. But
then again, I thought the paper was an
area paper. At least there are a lot of us
outsiders buying their paper thinking it is

an area paper.
If Mo Udall lived in our area he might

even change his mind. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s so easy to
dictate the needs of an area when you

If Greg Bohlen\[CloseCurlyQuote]s proposed project lives
or dies it was still a good idea for area
residents. But who cares about area
residents? Only area residents, and they
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t count. Everyone with authority
dictates to us, and we have no say in the
matter. So for now we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll just sit here and
be the tourists litter bag and try to ap-
preciate what pennies they happen to
toss our way.

--Over one-half of accidental

killed in the Vietnam War;

--57 percent of all arrests are due to or --

involve the consumption of alcohol;

--75 percent of broken homes are
alcohol related;

--50 percent of all new arrivals to
prison result from something done under
the influence of alcohol;

--70-80 percent of those who violate
parole and return to prison do so because
of something done under the influence of
alcohol;

--Over half the rapes and assualts are

of alcohol;

person every two minutes) from
something directly related to the con-

of alcohol;

--30,000
cirrhosis of the liver, eight times as

many of them because of alcohol as for Social

any other cause.

Not a single state in our country makes
money from the taxes on alcohol. The
cost of law enforcement, the cost of
money, time and life, the cost of
rehabilitation centers, mental in-
stitutions, welfare, etc., is far greater
than taxes ever pay for the sale of
alcoholic beverages.

To make alcohol more accessible at
this time would be inappropriate, 25
states have raised the drinking age in the
last few years. Five more will likely do so
this year. Driving while intoxicated laws
are being made tougher all over the
country. Illinois is among the states
taking the lead in getting tough on the
drinking driver.

It would be incongruous for Findlay, at
this time, to permit the sale of alcoholic
beverages.

Please get out and vote. Let us keep
our town dry.

Dear Findlay Citizens,

What is the most abused drug in the
United States today? Is it marijuana,
cocaine, heroin or all the pills and other
substances that people use today to get a
high? It is none of those. It is ALCOHOL.

There are six and one half million
known alcoholics in America today. But

reports; Study
University of California at Berkeley and

people die every year of Alcohol research

percent of the broken
homes of our country relate in some way
directly to the consumption of alcohol. If
that is true, 750,000 divorces occur each
year because someone decides to drink

parole and return to prison the per-
centage rises to around 75 percent. Is it
any wonder why our prison system is full
to capacity and overflowing?

Not one state, city or village makes
money from taxes on alcohol. Following
are figures for 1971 which were released
by the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare pertaining to the cost of the

: Sales Wa $550 million

Criminal justice cost........ $510 billion

WONG citakcassice $140 million
Income maintenance

payments .............. $2.2 billion

Total costs...........css000: $27 billion
Revenue made from

alcohol sales ............. $8 billion

Loss Loss Loss Loss Loss Loss. $19 billion

It should be quite evident we are
paying dearly for something that does
not represent one physical, social or
moral value to our citizens.

Just think how great our nation would
be if all that $35 billion being spent for
alcohol or its effects could be used to feed
the poor, take care of our elderly, give
our children a better education, pay our
teachers a better salary, retrain the
unemployed for new jobs, etc. The list
could go on and on.

There are over 100 verses in the Bible
pertaining to strong drink. Some of them
are as follows: Gen. 9: 20-27, Gen. 19: 30-
39, Lev. 10: 1-2, 9-10, Prov. 20: 12, Prov.
23: 29-35, I Cor. 6: 911, Gal. 5: 19-21, I
Tim. 5:23.

Now, if we as mothers and fathers are
to set a good example for the future
leaders (our children and young adults)
in this community, we will give these
statistics and God\[CloseCurlyQuote]s teachings a very
careful consideration. We hope you all
want to leave this community a good
place for our children to grow up in and
