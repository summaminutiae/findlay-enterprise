SAVE US BOTH MONEY

If you're going to be digging, be infor-
med first! Anyone who digs and damages
underground utilities and hasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t notified
the utility first can be held responsible for
the damages.

Come to the meeting to become
familiar with the one-call JULIE system.
This can save you time and money.

A representative from JULIE will be
there to explain what the digger\[CloseCurlyQuote]s role in
this system entails and also answer any
questions.

The meeting will be held April 5 at 1:30
P.M. at the American Legion Hall in
Sullivan.

EVERYONE WELCOME
