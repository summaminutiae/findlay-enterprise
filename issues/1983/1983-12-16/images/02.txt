I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know much about the safety or
dangers of natural gas,*but I know more

gas that according to village employee,

light switch. If you don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know what to do
about gas problems call the
employees. And for heaven\[CloseCurlyQuote]s sake don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
just tape the hole. That just won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t do it.
