\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Dont risk the shock!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
Keep your TV or CB antenna
away from electric wires.

A safety tip from:
Chris Robb, age 10, Pittsfield, lil

We couldn't have said it better ourselves, Chris.
The slightest contact linking a person with our
overhead lines could cause serious injury . . . or
even loss of life.

Locate your antenna a distance of at least
twice its total height from all overhead lines.
That way, if it falls during installation, or gets
blown down during a storm, it won't touch any
overhead lines.

If you use a ladder, watch where you place it. A
metal ladder is an excellent conductor of electricity.
Even a wooden ladder, if wet, can be the
instrument of a nasty shock if it touches an
overhead line.

When you're on the roof, anything you're
Carrying -- even metal guttering -- becomes
an \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]extended arm\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] that can bring you into

seem a safe distance away.

Stop by your CIPS office for a copy
of \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Public Safety around Electrical
Facilities\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s yours for
the asking. |
