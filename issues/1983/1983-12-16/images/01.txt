The tertiary filter was tested in the
past week by the Enviornmental
Protection Agency and was not accepted.

Despite a number of problems over the
past year with the tertiary filter, the
engineers did not test the tertiary filter
before the plant was accepted by the
village board. Lee Sierkerka said the
firm did not conduct tests on the

testers did not spend enough time at the

of maintenance at the plant contributed
to the failure of the filter. Village em-
ployee Doug Ryherd objected to this
remark.

Sierkerka said the filter would handle
average sewage flows, however, it would
not handle peak flows that occur on
normal days. This means the filter is
bypassed and the EPA is not satisfied
with this system.

Harshman and,Sierkerka both differed
on whether the problem was under the
warranty or not. \[OpenCurlyQuote]I don't know if it is or
not,\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] the engineer said. \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]We have never
seen the filter meet the standards it was

Board members appeared reluctant to
accept Harshman\[CloseCurlyQuote]s contention that the
filter problems were related to the
warranty. They asked for the opinion of
Eberspacher, and he told the board that
they would have a defense for holding off
on the payment; however, there would be
a cost incurred for the litigation, and
there was a chance that a judge or jury
would find against the village.
