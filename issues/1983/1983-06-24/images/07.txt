Most room air conditioners have the Energy
Efficiency Ratio (EER) number on the nameplate,
the appliance tag or in the accompanying
literature. In central units the number represents
the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER).

We love you more than words can

remain till death do we part; We will
meet again although life still goes on
in the usual way; We think of you
daily and wish it were play.

These numbers are indications of how much it
will cost you to operate the unit. The higher the
number the more efficiency--and the less it will
cost you to cool your room or home.

As a general rule, an EER of 10 is excellent, 9
or 8 is good and 7 or 6 is just adequate. For
example, a unit with an EER of 8 will deliver the
same cooling as a unit with an EER of 6 yet use
25 percent less electricity.

Within the same price range, you
may find air conditioners with quite
different efficiencies. When you
shop for an air conditioner, be
sure to ask about efficiency as
well as price.
