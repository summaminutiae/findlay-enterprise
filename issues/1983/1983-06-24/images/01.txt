Rankin resigns

In another matter, Village Attorney
Chris Eperspacher told the board he will
re-draft the village liquor ordinance and

submit it at the next board meeting, July
ll. Eberspacher will remove the or-
dinance stipulation which \[OpenCurlyQuote]prohibits
corporations from owning liquor
licenses. Home rule m can
limit liquor licenses, he said, but non-
home-rule municipalities cannot.

In addition to the revised liquor or-
dinance, Eberspacher will present the
village\[CloseCurlyQuote]s revenue sharing appropriations
at the next meeting. Eberspacher said he
will double the appropriations recom-
mended by the board to insure all of the
areas earmarked for funds will have
sufficient room for alteration.

In a discussion, some of the board
members expressed concern over the
status of the firm repairing and
repainting the tower of Illini Tank and
Tower, Taylorville. Some doubt was
raised as to whether or not the company
was paying prevailing wages, and if it
had sufficient insurance coverage.

The next board meeting is scheduled
for July 11.

Sewer saga continues

by Michael Lang
Purestream Industries Inc. became
the latest scapegoat for the Village of
Findlay\[CloseCurlyQuote]s sewer project which has left
the contractor, engineer, village board
members and residents of Findlay all
frustrated.

Contractor Hal Harshman
represented by attorney Harold Tenny at
Monday night\[CloseCurlyQuote]s special meeting, ex-
changed accusations with engineer Leon
Sierkerka as to why the sewer project
was not performing up to capacity. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It is
a fact the engineer approved the shop
drawings,\[CloseCurlyQuote] Harshman said. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]the EPA
did too,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Sierkerka replied.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It sounds like you\[CloseCurlyQuote]re passing the
buck,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Art Jay said. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think the
village should kick in another dime (for
the project).\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Board member Dave
Thurber agreed with Jay\[CloseCurlyQuote]s opinion,
saying the village has accrued more than
$1,000 in engineering costs since the
revised April 30 deadline.

The village is not the only group to
suffer financial losses since the deadline

Dairy month nietetiinians
Members of the Stitch-N-Time 4-H Club of Findlay passed out dairy treats at
Star Market on Saturday. In addition to cheese and crackers and fresh milk, the
4-H\[CloseCurlyQuote]ers gave out dairy tips and recipes in their special promotion of Dairy
Month. The club has sponsored several activities during the month of June
relating to dairy products.

curring attorney\[CloseCurlyQuote]s fees.
The manufacturer of the tertiary filter,
Purestream Industries Inc., surfaced as

~ the bad guy at the meeting. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve called

them (Purestream) at least six times,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

- Harshman said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]they keep saying

they\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll call back tomorrow.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]
\[OpenCurlyQuote]T relied on the manufacturer and

village engineer to evaluate the
designs,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

design specifications. Sierkerka said the
major criteria for the project --
sufficient tertiary filter surface area --
had been met.

Presently, the system can handle a
maximum flow of 70-80 gallons per
minute through the tertiary filter, he
said. A full flow rate of 18 gallons per
minute is required before the EPA will
release the final 10 percent of the
project\[CloseCurlyQuote]s funds.

One possible solution to the problem
which was suggested and discussed at
the meeting was to replace the two-inch
piping which leads to the tertiary filter
with three-inch piping. Neither Har-
shman nor Sierkerka could
the pipe replacement would solve the
problem.

Perhaps the only way to solve the
problem is through a lawsuit, something
which was hinted at during the last
regular board meeting. None of the
participants Tuesday seemed eager to
pursue the matter through the courts.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Before going to war,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] village at-
torney Chris Eperspacher suggested the
three parties -- the village, contractor
and engineer -- write letters to
Purestream suggesting a representative
from their company meet with
representatives from the other parties
and try to work out a solution. A meeting
date of Friday, July 8 was tentatively set.

school board reviews
drainage test results

by Cherise R. Cruit
The results of a recent drainage test
were reviewed by the Findlay School
Board along with sewer commissioner
Ron McClain and utility supervisor Bill
Rankin at the school board meeting last
Wednesday.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]T agree all of the problem is not at the
high school,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] McClain told the board. He
explained what (water and sewage) at
the high school was draining into the
Sanitary sewer system. There is a cross
connection from the old system to the
