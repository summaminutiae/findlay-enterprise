GOTTOM SEED MEALS.
Se Other Peed Varlon Gulle a» Mach
ii Cooma yperest ebay,

Much has been anid and written rela
tive te the use of cotton seed men! as &
cattle food. Nearly all investiguiors
agree in giving ita high value and urge
duirynien to nse this material, sot only
becnuse it is a cheap source of protein,
but because it also has a high manurinl
value. Practieal feeders differ greatly
in their estimates of cotton seed meal.
Some seem to use it very satiafnetorily
for awhile, and later conclude that the
feed is not well adapted for their pur-
poses. Occasionally a feeder observes
that the health of his animals is af-
fecied by the feeding of cotton seed too
freely, and it sometinies happens that
even after animnis bave heen fed for
months with apparent success that
they are injured by ite continued use.
it has also happened that cows felt
pos cotton seed meal do well for a
time sand that later the milk fiow is
diminished without any appurent
chuse,

There are at present no other concen
trated fecding stuffa which vary so
much in coinpesition as cotton seed
meals from different sources and dif-
ferent mills. Within three weeks the
Muine agricaltural experiment station
has examined samples varying from 22
per cent. to over 33 per cent. of protein,
This great variation in different Jot
of eottou Secil ment may explain t
difersnt estimates of differeat pra
ticnl feelers and of the same feed
at different times. If a cow. is feil 4
eotton sce meal containimg 226 pe
cent. protein, and is then fed ap equa
weight of 9 meal containing 52 per
cent,, it fs evident that the amount of
protein which she. peosives will have
been doubled by the change. Hishe has
heen fed up to ber fall capneity in the
firet instance, such an increase might
result disastrously. On the other hand,
changing from @ cotton secd of high
protein content to one of low protein
content would diminish the milk flow
unless the antount of meal fed is also
correspondingly increased. -- Raral
