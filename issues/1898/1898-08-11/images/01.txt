Satisfactory

othing...

There's a wreat deal of satisfaction to be de-
rived from wearing clothing that is satisfactory
in every respect. There's very few of us who
can wear pees the kind of clothes we would like
to wear. because our incomes will not allow
us to, but

Anyone Can Wear
Good Clothes

and have the satisfaction of knowing they fit
well and look well if they will patronize a
elothier who yoes into the markets with his
eyes open and picks out clothing that is made
\[OpenCurlyQuote]to wear and look well, and not merely put
together to sell. I have made the clothing
business a life-time study--studying the wants
of each customer, and when have pleased
@ man in style and fit and the price is right I
have a reasonable right to expect that the next
time that man wants a suit. a collar, pair of
cuffs, hosiery, underwear or a hat, he will
come to the man who took the pains to please
hini--that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s just what I am after--I want my
store to be headquarters for people who like
to be pleased. When you get anything at
either of my stores you have fit and satisfaction
guaranteed. When you want anything in the
clothing line come and see for yourselves and
you will understand the diference between
clothing made to SELL and clothing made to
wear and give the wearer satisfaction.

Yours for busineés,

BF SHERIDAN

Sullivan and Findlay.
