Corinth. But Grant had more gump-
tion, or whatever you call it, than to al-
low himself to be fooled In that way.
As a snatter of fact he had telepathic
informuaticn on various oceasions. It is
a niatter of record that on the afternoon
of the first day of the battle of Pitts-
burg Landing Sherman toki Grant thas
they must make preparations to retreat
over the river during the night, Grant
replied that Buel} would be up with re-
enforcements, and a victory woul be
won on the morrow. Sherman said that
inquiry developed the fact thar Buell
could not possibly reach the round in
time for the battle of the following day.
Grant replied: \[OpenCurlyQuote]Lam firntiy impressed

rich, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]that the very first case of well-
defined modern telepathy ovcorred
upwards of 6tyvearsavo. A lady in New
York was entertaining some friends in
her parlor, when she suddenly, as one
in # trance, began.to describe a ship-
wreek which she said she could mental-
ly see. She described it with aueh visid-

On the following morning a telegram
Was received announcingr the faet that
my brother had been killed at the bat-{
tle of Gettysburg on the preceding
evening, Of course mother knew that
&@ great battle was going on becanse the
funs could be heard very distinctly in
Harrisburg, but she had no sienns of t
knowing that her son was actually en- |
guged in the taille, or was where his!
life was in danger, She simply re-| ness of detail that a profound impres-
ecived the impression that he was shot,!slon was mide upon the minds of all
and then 15 minutes later that he wax! present. There happened to be one
dexd. fo days afterwards my unele | codl-healed person there who wrote
went ta Gettysburg and found the,
body of niy brother and had it removed |
to Harrisburg, where the remains were |
interred.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Et had another experience which was !
wery singular, Z was in the nationnl ;

ago, und by seme instinctive impulse }
I walked towards the graves of the |
teguiur arnvy soldiers. \[OpenCurlyQuote]There, te my!
great surprise, 1 saw the hendstone of }
Lieut. Wesley F. Miller. I called the}
attention of the superintendent to the
hendstone and asked him if he had any
means of knowing that Lieut. Miller
was buried there, and he suid that there +
eoult be no doubt of it. I told him that
I personally khew that my brother was
buried in Harrisburg, and he indiffer-
ently said: \[OpenCurlyQuote]Well, some other goldlef |
is buried there, and that name will de!
just as well for him as any other, now }
that he {« no longer fit for duty on this
earth.\[CloseCurlyQuote] |

"I either read or heard of a singular
story several years ago, which hud an |
amusing side toit. A veterna of one of
the union armics went to the national
cemetery, I believe it was at Gettys-
burg; and instinctively was led to a
grave bearing his own name, company
and regiment. He went off immediate-
ly and got a little cart full of flowers
which he brought into the cemetery and
deposited upon that grave. One of the
keepers asked him why he was so pro-
fuse in decorating that particular graye
and he responded: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Well, if there is
any grave on earth in which I ought to
tuke a grent deal of interest, and upon
which I should bestow a number of
floral decorations from time to time, it
is thet purticular grave, because 1 um
