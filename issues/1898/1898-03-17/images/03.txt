along the spper Mississippi, all
fic in the summer was by steam-
boat, which carried also the mail. In
Winter everfsthing was carried by

between St, Paul and Prairie du Chien

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]write. These stages followed the river
--how much of the distance on the ice
TL eannot say, butip my neighborhood,
where the river expanded and became
Lake Pepia, the route was all on the ice,
andmost of the way far from the shore.
Lake Vepin is some three miles wide
and 27 wiles Jong, and although in re-
ality onis a widening of the viver It is
"a truc juke. in which the current of the
fiver {s aimost lost, Where is no other
suck body of water in the whole length
of the Mississippi. The upper Missis-
sipp! is ssorn far below the level of the
eountry; consequently Lake Pepta Is
surrounded by bigh bluffs, with bold,
fint tops. Leading down to the Inke,on
both tie Minnesota and Wiscotsin
2 are many ravines or coulevs,
hy the watercourses and wooded.
Even iow there is much wild land
among the bluffs, |
It wax in the latier part of January
yenrke age that 1 found myacif at
Hawk's Landing, on the Minnesotn
side 07 the river just below the foot of
the like, whither I bad gone with an
aocle. He found that his business
would detain him Jonger than he ex-
peeted, and ke decided to send me
a back ulone on the stage. It should
"have left the Banding at one o'clock,
Dut it was deleyed somewhere down
the river, and did not arrive till neariy
three, ft was a full afternonn's drive
to Lake City, but the driver said he hud

threvsh on time, notwithstanding the
late sturt: He was a rough snd dissi-
pated inan, bat be had the reputation
of ulways keeping sober tilt after the
day"s tip had been completed, Butthe

lesan drinking before we atarivd,
nourh no one then noticed it, ile

<asion to know. A suppose Pcoukd not
bore been more than 12 or 13 years old,
although life in a new country and on
# furm had given me ability to take
gare of myself hexond my yenrs.
When we departed from the War
Eagle house on the teree, and swung
along up thé road under the shadow of
Wabushe Blut, with tho horses at a
gallop, I felt a sort of admiration for
the driver, notwithstanding his rough-
ness. We slackened somewhat wher
we gat Levond the line of houses along
the single street, and goon rounded the
biuff and kept.atong the edge of a bank
above the frozen river, It wug here that
the driver took his first driuk from his
bis. Hat bottle. This alarricd me, be-
eause 1 lad already seen wuch of the
effect of liquor on the cliss of men to
«which he belonged. Ie passed the bot-
~ \[OpenCurlyQuote]te to the passenger. who took a very

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s some sort of animal,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] went on
the man. He paused a moment and
then added: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They look like bigdogs.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] |

At that moment there came the ery
T had so often heard at home, only much
deeper, harsher and louder.

\[OpenCurlyQuote]re wolves!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I sald, ong 4
cracked the whip atthe horses, although |
that was hardly necessary, os they
heard the savage howl as well as we
aid and knew it meant danger.

They were indeed a pick of timber
wolves, starved out of the Wisconsin
conlees and crossing the lake in scurch
of food on the Minnesota silty, The
howl which they set np showed ther
thought they had found it unexpectedly
on the Jake, Tho horses stenck into a
fast gallop and the sieigh began to
sway and bound around in an nneem-
fortable tnanner. 1 looked hack and
caw that the wolres had struck the rond
and were toming trehind. he horses
were now running os fist as they could
with so heavy a track. ft seemedas if
we should be thrown out the next mo-
ment, and it was certain that weshould
be overtaken in nor ense.

The second time [ tooked back Esaw
that the pack was much acarer--I could
make out the leaders and see that there
must be 20 or 30 of the animata, all told.
My fellow passenger was clinging ty
the seat ersing to mie to drive faster, al-
though the horses were fairly running
away amd Ll hud practically no contro:

slightly. They all stopped aml surged
around the things 2 moment; then they
enme on.

I hear? the man throwing out the
nil sacks and some other parcels, but
the wolves dil not pavce much for ;
these, They were soon elon or than ever, |
and, the man said afterwards, within
a few rods of us. 1 kicked the buffalu ;

my knees in the bottom of the sleight |
the man wrenehed Foose the scatoand |

These were the Inst things which we }
had to throw out. The robes seemed to {
ficlay the wolves longer phan anything!
elue. They stopped and tors them to }
shreds. We gota quarter-mile start, {
AN of this time the dranken driver |
was sleeping like w log in the bottom of |
the sleigh.

The horses were beeoring exhausted,
and f could feel that they were going
slower. [I now urged them on with
whip and voice, but it seemeit to make
po difference. The howling behind us
began to come plainer; the wolves had
