WAR REMINISCENCES.

JIM LANES WOMAN SPY.

She Rore a Cammionion from Abraham
Lincoln,

In one of the apartments at the Nar
tional Woman's Relief corps home, in
Madison, U., lies Elizabeth W. Stiles,
aged 62 yeurs, who recently submitted
to a very severe surgical operation,
from which the attending physicians
gare no hope that she would recover,
yet there is every indication thet the
wonderful powers of endurance whieh
have served her well in former yeurs
will bring the old lady through her prea
ent hardghip,

When 21 years old the young women
went to Chicago, and earned her own
Hving until 1646, when she married
Jacob Stiles, and 13 yeurs subsequent
they took up their residence in Shawnee-
town, Kan. where they made for them-
sulves a nice, comfortable home.

Mere Mrs. Stites renlized her first sor-
row by the death of her husband, who
was shot down at histown gate in Octo-
ber, 1862, by a band of guerrillas who
had dragred him from his bed to mor
der him before her eyes because he had
sworn allegianee to the cause of the
union, This took place after midnight.
The rebels cume dressed In the blue
garb of union soidicrs, 160 fn the hand,
directed by the famous guerrilla chief-
tain Qnantre!ll

Mrs. Stiles had not yet retired, and,
being deccived by the color of the uni-
forms, she very rendily admitted the
men. who compelled Mr. Stiles to ret up
anil go out of the house. As the man\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
bndy sank tothe ground with many bul-
let holes in itone of the assacsins leveled
aAresplyer at Mrs. Stiles, who stood hor
ror stricken on the poreh. As he was
nhout to shoot Quantrell stopped him
withathrent to shoot him if he molested
the woman. Mrs, Stiles was allowed to
reenter her house and that time was not
further molested, bat thereafter she
wis subjected to so many menacing
actions from those opposed to the cause
of the north {imt she finally decided
that longer residence there would be
tinkafe, and went to Fort Leavenworth
with her ndpoted children under escort
of an band of soldiers.

The cnuse of this nnusital persecution
was that it was known that Mrs, Stiles
had done some detective work for

A SENTRY GRASPED THE BRIDLE.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Unele Sam,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] but how extensive her
work in that line had bron was not even
surmised, Her antipathy for seeession-
iste waxgreatly Increased by the murder
of her hushaud, and she vowed to devote
her lifetorevenge. Having been on rev
eral liltte expeditions for the good of
the union exuse she had become some-
what known by army leaders, who had
learned that the woman Was a trusty
ally, and had sent her name to head-
quarters, She bad been at the fort but
a short time when she received a letter
from Gen. Lane, asking her to come to
Washington. This Ictter war also
signed by Abraham Lincoin,

Senntor Marvin, of Missouri, and e
company of about 75 others, were pre-
pariug for an carly start for the cap-
Hal, and Mrs. Stiles accompanied them.
Upon presenting herself to Gen. Lane,
she was informed that her future sery-
ices were desired as a spy, and she ac-
eepted the proposition gladiv. Refore
engaging at her new duties she returned
! to Leavenworth for her chittren, whom
\[OpenCurlyQuote]she took back to Washington, the tedi-
aus fonrney ¢onsuming several montis\[CloseCurlyQuote]

time. She placed two children In school
fn Washington. and, taking the other
chit. a girt of 12. with her, she re
- parted ready for servicer. and was on
inlmost constant duty thereafter until
the close of the rebellion. during which
i time she dit good work in 19 different
ostates anil Canale. the daughter, Clara,
fecompantving her mother on most of
her expeiitions.

Mrs, Stiles was personally acquaint-
fed with nearly all of the noted generals
| of that time. as her service bronght her
under their direction. She treasures
timonge her keepsakes a letter of recom-
tuomdiation written and signed by Abra-
hnin Lincoln.

The brave wonrn faced death many
tines. and her eoolness on such ocea-
sions. and tact and ability for meeting
nocessare reqiirements on all\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] occk-
Riens, , caved the sreret of her success
as a spy.

She likes to tell how she \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]hnod-
winked\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] a confederate general on \[OpenCurlyQuote]one
eceision when she was arrested and
charred with being apr. It was at
Jeiforson City, Mo. Her horse was
taken from her and she wns escorted
ta Gen. Price for examination, to whom
the confessed to being a spr. but sq well
posted was she on the ecneral state of
affairs that she succecdal ifn making
the general helieve that she was 1 con-
foilerate spy. and she not only went
free, but was given a better horse and
firearms and sent on her way,

One dark night. when Mra. Stiles and
ther daughter were out on a tong ride
on the Kansas-Missouri border, the
daughter fell astecp on her horse (not
an uncommon occurrence), and didn't
know when a sentry grasped the bridle
of her mother\[CloseCurlyQuote]s horse and attempted to

arrest her, The gitl was ewelkened by
8 pistol abot, and ber mother was sons
beside her, but there wan a vacancy in
the picket line,

The old lady relates with pride how
ghe onte directed the eapture of a can-
\[OpenCurlyQuote]pon, with only her husband and daugh-
ters to assist her, and secured the priae
that several bands of men had tried for
unswecessfully.

An Hlustration of the unjust perse-
eution which this woman was subjected!
to during her residence In Shawnee-
town is shown In the event of 2 holiday
when. she was teaching school. To-
gether with a teacher ip an adjoining
Wstriet she planned to give the children
a plenic, and before leaving town her
scholars marched around the liberty
pole in the village green, enrrying the
xtars and stripes. They then went to
the woods, not faront, where they were
rearcely settled for the day\[CloseCurlyQuote]s sport
when a man rode up, handed Mrs. Stiles
a note and depurted without a word,
The note informed her that if she al-
lowed her scholars to repeat the liberty
pole parade with the union flag she
might expect a treat of tar and feath-
ers. Such was the nature of the ele-
ment in which che lived.

In the incidents of her travels it not
infrequently became neerssary for her
to dress the wounds of some unlucky
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]bluecoat.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] And even amputations of
ft minor nature have fallen to her Int
in ease of emergency. The woman's
mind fe not at all dimmed by her four-
seore years and her recollections of
names and dates if something remark-
while.

After the close of the war she took
up her residence in Venango county,
Ya., where she continued to make her
home until within the past two years,
when she entered the W. R. C. home.

Mrs. Stiles was never wounded and
could never be induced to ask for a
pension until a few weeks ago, when
she mide application to the gorern-
ment for redress for the amount of her
Tors when sh was obliged to sacrifice
everything she possessed In Shawnee-
town.--Cincinnati Enquirer.

THE SOUTH'S MANY COLONELS.

ee

Posnible Explanation ef Their Sam-
ber in an Oficina? Statement,

For many years, indeed since the
close of the civil war, it has been a
standing joke among the paragraphers
and in variety theaters that the conu-
federate army was composed almost
wholly of steff officers, and that the
number of colonelsdistributed through-
out the south and in the states of the
southwest was materially greater than
the number of male adult civilians. It
is certainly a fact, asall travelers attest,
that there are more colonels, mafors,
and generals iy the southern than in
the northern states, and this is n fact,
despite what is a matter of general
knowledge, too, that the southern army
wae materially smaller throughout the
war then the northern forces.

Anexplavatlonoftheapparent enom-
aly bas recently appenred in a state-
ment which shows in detail thet the
number of southern officers was rel
atively larger than the mamber of
northern officers during the civil war,
The official confederate army list
shows one general in chief, Robert E.
Lee, and seven full generals, as follows:
Cooper, Albert. Siiney Johnston, Bean-
regard, Joseph E, Johnston, Smith,
Bragg. ~ Hood, The number of lieu-
fenar = ernin {n the confederate
army, Stonewall Jackson, Hill, Rarly,
Buekner, Wade Hampton ond Gordon
among them, was 10, and there were be-
sides 61 major generals nnd more than
200 brigadier generals. This was much
larger thao rhe army roll in respect
of staff officers on the union side at a
correspondisg period. Before the es-
tablishment of the office of lentenant
general there were four major generats
and 11 brigadier generals in the regu-
lar army. and 20 major generals and
180 brigadier genérals In the volunteer
service. There was, corresponiingty,
a larger number of colonels and majors
in the\[CloseCurlyQuote] sonthern than fn the northern
army, and the reason for this wits te
be found jn the fact thatthe commands
of southerners were generally smaller
and more widely separated. The north-
ern forces constituted the attacking
army; the southern forees after the
battle of Gettysburg were on the de-
fensive, and much of the conflict which
continued during the closing years of
the strife was, so far ns the routhern
men were engaged in it. of n desultoty,
guerrilla character, The services of
sharpshooters, of small attacking col-
amns, of commands ereanized for for-
aging purposes, or to cover n retreat,
were in detail. and the commander of
each detail took, by courtesy and under
military usage, a title nstigh in its way
asa northern commander woulll receive
if {n charge of a force pechaps eight
or ten times larger. It is a well-huown
fact that military men having titles
are af slow to surrender them and te
forego their use as officeholders are
to retire from the honors and emolu-
ments of publicstation. The rule \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]once
R colonel, always a colonel,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] still pre-
rails In the south. and it applies in like
manner to generals, majors and captains
ns well. A man who may have acted
for a few hours, perhaps, at the head
of a detachment as ita colonel, though
setually 8 corporal, has since the close
of the war continued to be known as
colonel.--N. Y. Sun,
