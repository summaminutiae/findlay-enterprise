Sunday, when it became known that
the Spanish goyernwent bad formally
requested the recall of Consul Generul
Lee at his past at Havana, to which re-
quest the United States had courteously
bat lirmly refused to comply; also that
the Spanish government has suggested:
the impropriety of sending relict xup-
plies to the Cuban reconcentradoes on
the cruiser Moutgomery and gunboat
Nashville, to which suggestion the
United States had given a like answerijo
the negative,

The first intimation of thesm steps
cane in a brief aml explicit cable dis-
patch from Madrid, Prior to its ro-

That some Spaniards are of the opin-
fon that an attack on Havana will be
gmade is believed to be shown by the
abnormal activity displayed on board
the Virenya. On the best naval authori-
ty the statement is made that the Viz-
eaya is in a coustant state of readiness
fur les, aud that picket boats
are on the alert day and night inside the
harbor and outside the harbor at night.
Tt in pointed out that the men-of-war
¥Yiecaya and Almirante Oquindo might
be caught in a blockade and fail an
