NEWSPAPER REPORTERS.
A Detense of Thely Relinkiiey mag
integrity.

A very common error is prevalent
that the work of reporters, piven in
newspapers, a6 3 rule ie not entitled to
Fes or credence. Wt is generally
aasumed that the reporter writes chief-
ly or wholly to make a sensation, or in
gome way interest readers without re-

to nets, While just the reverwe
is the truth in all reputable newapaper
establishments.

It is eafe to assume that the state-
yaents of reporters given in the leading
reputable journals vf the country ure
quite as truthful as are the yeneral
aiatements from the pulpit when the
mivister gets omtside of strigtly re
ligtous tenchings, and very ninch more
truthful than are the public expres-
sions of most {f not oll of the leading
professions, With very few exerptions

RETAINING A SEAT.

& Jasgment Whick Is of Interest to
Katlway Travelers,

X judgment of the greutest impor
tance and interest to railway travelers
was delivered recently by Judge Emilen,
A gentleman traveling from London
te Hastings had ocension to leave the
tarriage at Tunbridge Wells, and took
the ordinury precaution of reserving
Jhis seat with his umbreila and newapa-

jp While he was absent another

+ \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]parsengor seized his place and refused
t vacate it until forcibly ejected. As
a@ result an action for damages was
brought against the original owner of
the «cat by the intruder, and a connter-
elaim far <imnihir damages was eritored
by the other side as well. The judgrinent
delivered was one whinh will commend
itself te 99 out of every 100 travelers,
The claim fer damages for efeeiment
was Usmixsed and the counter-claim
alipwisl.

Por the future, therefore. the ean-
tankerons individaal who persists in
d@isturbios the eomfort and eanven-
jence of travelers in the manner inde
ented will know how he stands. and
that if the owner of the seat thinks ft
to buidle hineeutoech and crop the Int
ter Will nat onts have the symygaithy of
the pouldic. but che fiw as well on his
aside. There con be nyu question what-
ever that the nnivercil mode of retain-
fuga sest inoa railway carriaye is a
most reasonable and convenient one,
fad the thanks of the public are due
te Judve Emden for his very clear aad
neusihle interpretation of the Inw. Not
the feast important potne in his fuvtg-
ment is his assertion thet the hobler of
® seat wos entitled to nse rensonable
force to ejert an intrader.- Landon
