The Lord ts my shepherd. --Isalins rxitl,, 1

What with post and rail fences, and
our pride in Southdown, Astrakhan
ani Flemish varieties of sheep, there
ismo ace now of the old-time shepherd.
Such an one bad abundance of oppor-
iimity of beraming e poct, being ont of

doors 12 hours the day and oft-times

waking up in the night on the hille
Hf the stars, or the torrents, or the sun,
or the Howers had anything to say, he
wes very apt to hear it. The Ettrick
shepherd of Sevtland, who afterwards
took bis seatin the brilliant circle of
Wilson and Lockhart, got his wondcr-
ful partie inspiration fa the ten years
in which he was watching the Hovis of
Mr. Laidinw. There is often 2s veet
poctry in the rugped prose of the
Scotch shepherd, One of these Sentech
shepherds lost his only sou, and he
kkncit down im prayer, and sus over
heard tossy: *'Oh, Lord, it has seemed
good im Thy province to take from me
the staff of my rizht hand at the time
when to 8 band blind mortals E seciued
to he most in need of it; and low!
shall climb up the hill of sorrow and
auld are without it, Thon mayst ken,
but Idinna.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

In his boyhood be had heard the

the red deer into premature. sicicness;
and when he beeame @ man he said:

the sheep were not yoing sstray, the
shepherd would often uscit ane sort of
crutch, leaning on it; but when the
sheep were out of the way, the crook
wes always busy pulling them beck.
All we, like sheep, have gone astray,
and had lj, not been. for the shepherd's
crook, we would have fallen long ago
over the precipice.

Furthermore, consider the shepherd's
pasture gropnis. The old shepherds
used to take the sheep upon the moun-

valleys in the winter. The sheep being
out of doors perpetually, their wool
was better than if they had beon kept
in the hot atmosphere af the atieep-eot.
Wells were dug for the sheep and cov-
ered with large stones, in order that
the hot weather might not spoil the
water. Anil then the shepherd led his
flock wherever he would; nobody dis-
puted his right. So the Lord our Shep-

& WORD OF ADVICE
Bo These Caming te Alaska o-
Biendike Gels Fields,

One thing should be impressed upon
every miner, prospector or trader com-
ing to Alaskan, to the Kiondike, or the
Yukon country, and that ip the neces-
sity for providing an adeguate sod
proper food supply. Whether procured
im the Stutes, in the Dominion, or at
the supply stores hure or further on,
this must be bis prinwry concern.
Upon the manner in which the miner
hax dbwerftd or neglected this preesn-
tion anore than upon any other one
thing will his suecess or failure depend.
These supplies must be healt iitul and
should Le concentrated, but the mout
careful attention in the selection of
foods thut will keep unimpaired in-
definitely ander all the conditions
which they will have to encounter is
imperative. For instance, as bread
Faised with baking powder must be re
lied upon for the chief part of every
ineal, imagine the helpicsuness of a
miner with a can of spoiled baking
powder, Buy only the very bext flour;

ek. Sterling Relates 2 Bit of Was-
Time Mistery.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]When I was promoted from tha
Geventh Obio to the One Hundred and
Third Obio in September, 1862," said
Col. J.T. Sterling, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]and made Hieuten-
ant colonel, the regiment was at Snow's
Found, a few miles from Cincinnatl. At
dinner or the day J arrived, my colonel,
who is now Gen. Casement, zaid that the
regiment was in need of drilling, and
that E had hetter commence at once. J
was there for that purpose. So Lordered
ont the regiment and went to work, T
noticed an officer who was sitting on a
horse and watehing our movements.
The story is.on him and I won't give his
name, but he lives in Toledo now. |
learned afterwards that he was colonel
ef another regiment In the same bri-
gate.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It was the first time I had ever
drilled a regiment, but I bat read and
practiced and believed E knew the tae-
ties pretts well. There is a movement
knows as \[OpenCurlyQuote]doubling en a center.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The
tactics prescribe that as soun as the
aligament is made and the command
*Front\[CloseCurlyQuote] given, the several guides should
return to thir places. Gn this occa-
+ 0, the guides not Baving been in-
atructed, failed to go where they be-
longed. ET nt once gave the order:
\[OpenCurlyQuote]Guides past? which I consitered more
military than telling them to go to their
places.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Having: finished my drill, (dismissed
(TM)HYy regiment and went to my tent.
Shortly after Col. Casement sent for me:
When EF went to him, he sald: A

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote] thought you knew how to drilla
regiment.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]A5 [ was flnttering myself that Dhad
fone well, this remark rather set me
brek. \[OpenCurlyQuote]Wherein have I failed? I asked,
rather anxions}y.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]*That's worse than the other, said
Col. Casement. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]To make mistakes is
bad enough, but not to know it is
worse,\[CloseCurlyQuote]

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Not knowing Gen, Casement as well
then as f did afterward, I supposed that
he was in dead earnest, and for a mo-
ment f felt pretty blue; hut I beran to
ree a little twinkle in his eye. Finally,
after rating me considerably opon my
ignorance, he informed me that the
ofticer of Gue of the adjoining regimenta
had heen watehing me and had taken
the trouble to cume to him and inform
him that in making the movement of
\[OpenCurlyQuote]doubling on the center\[CloseCurlyQuote] I had given the
command: \[OpenCurlyQuote]iuides post,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] when every-
body knew there was no such order in

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]the tnetics.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Casement lovked upon it as a joke,
and soon it spread through the whole
command, the general opinion being
that the offierr from the other regiment
was n little officiois in reporting such»
mintler,

that there would be a review of \[OpenCurlyQuote]the di-

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Since I eame to Washingten, a
couple of weeks ago, I beve had not less
than a dozen invitations by friends to
accompany them to the top of the
Washington monument, but each bas
been declined with thanks,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said J. M,
Underwood, of California, to a Star re-

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]There isn't money enough in the
world to tempt me to go to the tap of
the monument. I recall with « shodder
one time in my life when I went up
high enough to more than eatisly me,
and J made a solemn row that if {£
lived to get back to'terra firma I would
spend the rest of my life as near to the
earth as possible.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]How was it? Well, J don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t mind
telling you, if I do not bore you. Dur-
ing the war the government employed
Prof. Low, an aeronaut, to make ascen-
sions in the interest of the union*army-

it was practicable, inasmuch as the
inorenenis of the enemy could be eas-
ily watched. At Yorktown, ¥2., one
day, Gen. Fitz.Jobn Porter, who was
then in command, made an ascension
with Prof. Low, and I accompanied him.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Usually two soldiers were detailed
te aecompany the professor. On this
occasion only one was negessary, The
two men who had been previously de-
tailed began to quibble among them-
selves as to whoskould go and the cap-
tain of onr company finally gare the or-
der that neither should go.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What\[CloseCurlyQuote]s the matter with your go-
lug, Underwood? the captain yelled to
me.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t stop to think what I wae
getting into, and assented at once.
The balloon was controled by ropes at-
tached to windlnsses on the ground.
Two soldiers were usually stationed at
these windlasses, and they pulled the
balloon back to earth upon a signal
from the professor. On this occasion,
the men ot the windlass let. us up ser-
eral hundred feet, and, as the profes-
sor was abont to survey the enemy
with his glass, something gave wey
down below and we began soaring away
in spnce.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Higher and higher we went. the
windlasses dangling at the end of the
ropes in the air, Prof. Low took \[OpenCurlyQuote]

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We will go up until we get into on-

ew tw Make War jeu MWeody.

Asa military man, I wish to point out
what seems to me to be military em
rors in the conduct of the campaign
(Jameson's) which we have just been
considering, i have seen active service
in the field, and it was in the actualities
of war that [ acquired my trainiug
snd my right to speak. I served two
weeks in the beginning of our civil
war, and duringall that time command-
eda battery of infaniry composed of 12
men. Gen. Grant knew the history of
my campaign, fort toldittohim. Taiso
told him the principle upon which I had
conducted it; which was to tire the
enemy. I tired ont and disqualified
many bartaliors. yet never had a casu-
alty myself nor io. 7-man. Gen. Gra
Was not giten to paying complim
set he said frankly that if I had com
dneted the whole war much bloodshed
would have been spared, and that what
the army might have lost through the
{nspiriting results of collision in the
field would have been amply made
by the liberatizing infigences of sane.
