WHITE HOUSE DINNERS|

\[OpenCurlyQuote]There will be no more diptomatic din-
mere ut the white house during this sea-
son, The social customs of nations are
smuning and ridiculous to men who do
aot believe in any sort of temperance.

During the next eight or nine months
the president of the United States will
probably be able to maintain friendly
relutions with the dipfomatic
eentatives of foreign nations In this
sity without g. og them meat and
drink. During cach winter season,
however, it ia expected that the presi-
dent shall give a series of dinners,
which are served after dark, where food
of the most costly kind in great abun-
dace is served and washed down with }
gallons of cham: and other wines,

stead of dependitg upon the British for-
eign office for consideration. Mr. Hay,
as our ambassador to Great Britain,
nts the president of thia repub-

lic. When Mr. Bayard was our min-
ister, before the ambagzadorship was
created, he could not have audience
with the queen; but as soon as he had
been promoted to be an ambassador he
became & ater personage,
it may be well to remember that all
of our ambuesadora to foreign countries
are men of euperior ability and sa-
gacity. he came may be said of the
ambassadors who are sent by foreign
countries to this capitai. In all emer-
gencies am ambassador must represent
tho head of hig mation. Therefore it is
necesgary that each ambassador should
possess intellectual ability and eduen-
tional acquirements which are prac-
tically equal to those of the sovereign
or president ot the head of his govern-
ment.
A ense in point concerning ministers
aecurred recently. The Spnuish min-
ister to this country, Senor De Lome,
committed a grave brench of courtesy.

entitled. The plan adepted of making |
the order of precedence among the |
diplomats depend simply on lougth of
service here is un admirable solution of -
the problem on the whole.

The various ambassadors and tain-:
isters Jocated In Washington give dine;
ners to the secretary of state aml the |
assistant secretary. They also enter: |
tain our sennters and represcntitices j
in u similar manner, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The presitient |
gives receptions aud dinners to the
wnembers of the anpresme court and to
the senators aud representatives daring
the entire ante-Lenten season.

At the diplomatic dinner at the white
house the British ambazsador is given
the seat of honor becatise he js regarded
as the dean of the diplomatic corps, on
account of his seniority of rank by con-
tinuous service at this capital. The
president offers his arm to the wife of
the British ambassador and leads the
way to the dining-room, followed by
the diplomats and the ladies of their
families, The president stands beside
his sea@ein the middle of one side of the
long table, and remains standing, until
all of the ladies and gentlemen have
found their way to their respective
Places. All then take their seats aud
the banquet begins.

When the guests arrive at the white
house they are escorted upstairs, the
gentlemen going to the library anil the
ludies to one of the larger bedroonis in
order to remove theirowraps, Present-
iy they go down to the large enst room,
where the president and his wife are
found awasitmig to receive then.
Promptly at eight o\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock the steward |
of the white house opens the door of |
the state dining-room nud bows to the
president, who thereupon leads the pro-
session to the table.

Before going downstairs to dinner |
each one of the gentlemen finds on a}
teble in the library aq envelope wat
dressed to himiaclf, unsealed, with the!
American eagle in gold stamped on the |
envelope. Within the envelope each
gentleman discovers a card with ber-
eled and pitied edges, bearing the nae

To its dorsal fina copper tag was se-

tleman receiving the card where he and
his partner for the evening ure to sit at.
the table. Thus it is practically impos-
sible for any error to be made in seat-
ing the guests at these big banquets.
The Inst president's reception was in- .
definitely postponed because of the
sinking of the battle ship Maine, where-°
by so many of our sailors lost their lives. ;
That dreadful catastrophe shocked the |
civilzed world, and it caused thrills of /
horror in this city. There was such a}
spontaneous burst of sentiment that!
even society quailed before it, and all
social affuirs were brought toa sudden ;
termination. Thus it happened that the
social rounds were stepped at the white
house; and, now that Lent is here, they
will not be resumed during the pres-
ent season. :
It is not generally known that it is
the duty of the president to accept an |
invitation to dine with an ambassador, |
but that itis beneath his dignity todine ;
with a minister plenipotentiary. Am-*
bessadors are the incarnation of their
sovereigns. The Uritish anvassartor

reason he may persenaliy eal! ayou the
