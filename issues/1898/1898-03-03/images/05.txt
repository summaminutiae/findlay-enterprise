rated an interesting reminiscence. He
said: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]When 1 was 9 momber of the

were sometimes so exciting as to be al-
most dangerous. When Pettibone, of
Tennessee, wanted to fight with me I
merely lnughed at him and told him
that these wrangles in the house of rep-
resentatives reminded me of the great
@og Aght in Gilead. You must un-
derstand that Gilead is a great place
for meetings in Florida, and about £4

_ there wus 2 dog fight, from which all

other events date in that section since
that time, The citizens there will tell
