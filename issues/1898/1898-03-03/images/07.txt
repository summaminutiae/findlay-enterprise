DESTRUCTIVE FUNGUS.

Hew te Yroat Srowm-Ret on Phavan

3t is scarcely necessary to repeat the
general remarks on treatment for fun-
gus dizeases published in several previ-
one bulletins. But concerning brown-
rot (Monilia frocticens) we may say
that only the most persistent effort can
hold this fungus ip cheek. As ali grow-
ers have observed, the decayed fruits
hany to the twigs wid persist over win-
ter. It ip from these in the carly days
of spring that an abyndant crop of
spores are borne, and the petals of the
flowers, young lenves, and even many
branches, are atracked. These mum
ited trafes ala hang on all simmer and |
continue te produce spores. Henes, by |
the time the fraitea become half-grown |
or begin to muture, the infecting spores |
May come from the old deeayed froin
of Ute previous year or from more re-
cent infeetion on the young growth of |
the eurrent yenr. Whenever the fruit)
hus become badly attucked treatment }
ts quite weeless.

The proper plan fa to remote ati de
enyed frult from the orchan! when the
trees are free from folie, as it can oe |
easily seen at thin time: ther, before |
the huts éwell in the spring, wash the i
trees thoroughly with a solution of:
concentrated Lye or of sulphate of cnp- |
per. The frat olution shonld be made |
by dissolving eight cans of ye in 50}
gions of water, and the copper wttl- |
