For the means of finding new pro-

tries which have not felt tha pulas of
modern progresa, Such countries have
yot to be equipped with the merhan-
ism of production and of Juxary, which
has been created in the progressive
countries by the savings of recent gen
erations, They have got only te ob-
tain buildings and machinery--the
necessary elements in producing ma-
chine-made goods--but they hare te

filam their rivers, build aqueducty for
their water supplies and sewers for
their towne and cities. Asia and Afri-
Ca are the most promising of these
countries. Japan has already made her
entry, almost iike Athene fyll-armed

LIVE OF STRAWBERRY BEDS,

Among the best and most success-
fal growers of the strawberry not less
than two fall crops are expected be-
fore replanting. That Is, the plants
are set in the spring and not allowed
to fruit the following season, all run-
ners being kept off and thorough cuti-
tivation practived. The {following
summer should bring a good crop, al-
thopeh a better one is ustally had
the second season, In some locations,
and especially on sandy soils under
good cultivation, even a third full}
crop may be had, but the soll must be
rich and full of Hie to produce this
result. Instanees are on record of
goal crops for four, five and even six
sears in succession, but these are ex-
ceptional eases and may usually be
traced to the fact that new plants have
been set among the old ones each year
from unent runners in numbers ex-
ceeding the original plants. This
would account for the unuaual seem-
ing longevity of the plantation. As a
rble, however, if three reasonably
large crops can be obtained it is all
that are to be expected, and new plan-
tations snowld be set every second or
third year to keep up the only system
of cropoing 'n which there is profit.

SENATOR LODGE DESCRIBES BEN-
EDICT ARNOLD'S FLIGHT
FROM WEST POINT.

It was the 25th of September, the day
upon which the attack was to be made,
and the post delivered, and Arnold had
no reason to think that ali would not
come to pass as he had planned. Even
such a hardened and reckless man as
Arnoh! may have felt a little natural
nervousness under these conditions. If
he aid, the first event of the day was
not likely te console him, for at break-
fast appeared Hamilton and McHenry,
aides of the commander-in-~chief
Washisgton had returned sooner than
bad been expected, and it Was going to
be extremely difficult to betray West
Point under his very eyes. The Gen-
eral himself bad turned off to look at
some redowbts, and telling his sides
that, like all young men, they were in
love with Mrs. Arnold, had bade them
ride on fo the Robinson house. So a
pleasant party sat down to breakfast,
one of them revolving many things in
his mind about which he did not con-
verse. Presently a note was brought
to Arnold. He read it with but slight
appearanve of emotion, sald he must go
to Weat Point, and teft the room. The
note was Jamieson\[CloseCurlyQuote]s letter. The plot

FOOTBALL THIS YRAR.

eee

The season is to be an early one,
and the general feeling is that it wilt
be a rapid one. The teama must be
shaken into shape quickly, and will be
calied upon to play difficult meteyas
when hardly out of the preliminaries,
The Yale-Princeton game is scheduled
for a date before the middle of Wo-
vember, while the Harvard-Pennsyl-
vania game will be played on Novem~
ber §. The appeerance of four ot Wne
big teams thus in some of their moat
iniportant matches before the middle
of the football month, is something
hitherto unheard-of, and will mean a
tot of severe work for the cnaches.
There have been times in previous sea-
sons when at that period of the yoar
the second elevens were able to best
the \[OpenCurlyQuote]varsities ai all four of thene in-
stitutions, owing to the late dovelop-
ment of the first elevens. It may work
a hardship apon some of the big fel-
lows Who mature sipwiy, but it will be
&@ godsend, on the other band, to same
of the light, flery, dashing players, whe
in & long seaeon smash themselves te
pleces before the end of Novembar.
Certainly no men ought to go fine pe-
tween the end of September and the
second week in November, and
coaches of Harvard and Pennay)
at Jeast, can afford to drive their men
up well for such a date as November
5.

The general \[OpenCurlyQuote]outlook of the big
teams is also peculiar. Princeton will
be strong In the line, but badly awept
out of veterans behind it. Yale wilt
look over a fleld quite the reverse of
this, having fost most of her line bat
kept her hack men. Pennsylvania wilt
work earnestly to secure what eho hes
taiesed for several. goasons--a good
connection between line and halves im
the shape of thogoughiy satisfactory
qnarter-back work. Harverd will pro-
fit largely from the material she can
draw from her last year\[CloseCurlyQuote]s freshman
team--a really first-class organization
