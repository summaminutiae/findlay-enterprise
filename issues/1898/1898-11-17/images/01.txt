CUTTING PRICES

Is an easy matter for a merchant who has
his goods marked way up for the purpose
of misteading his customers, but we don't
de Tusiness that way. Everythiny in our
stere is piarked in plain figures, and we ask
the same price of all, hut when we make a
cut in prices it is an absolute sacrificing of
vahwes. See what we are offering this week
in the way of ARGAINS:

We ask you to go inte any \[OpenCurlyQuote]clothing store and
look at their poods \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]and get their prices - be sure
to look well to the quality --and then come to our
store and sec if the goods we are offering are not
of a litde Letter quality, a litth: more care used in
the making, the style absolutely correct and the
price just a litte lower---look and consider all these
things, then decide where to buy--and we know
where you'll buy--you will buy of-us.
