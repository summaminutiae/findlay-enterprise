\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]She's got the idea plain enough,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Rhoda said that. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Mm getting slong
splendidly. She's the meat gensilie girl

ther I'd better go now? Maybe i'd bet
ter walt, just as I'd made up my mind
au\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] give her time to tatk it over with
her mother before f come right out with
the question. Eavill.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and it was well
that he came to this devision and ad-
hered to it. as he congratulated himself
a few days later.

The deacon might have stayed until
Mrs. Mason's retarn, bat a yonugg girl
friend of Rhaia\[CloseCurlyQuote]s come, and that put\[OpenCurlyQuote]an

the deacon, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Maybe it's like the meanies

his son might hare caught the diseare

--ixseh Waterman, in L.A. W. Bulletin.

BEACON WADE was hoeing ia the
gardeo, elose by the road, on the
morning when the ides canie to him
that it wonld be a good plan forhim to
get martivd again.
qt The way in which the idea came to

ene said: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Goo mornmg, Deacon
Wade,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] in @ voice that made him think
of blackbirds and woholinks, and he
looked up to see Rhoda Mason smiling
over the fenee at him,

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]ood morning, gvod morning.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] re-
sponded the dercen, delighted:y.
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Heautiful morning, isn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t it?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Charming,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] answered Rhoda. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Ifow
fe Mrs. Wheelock?) Well,.1 suppose?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

"She's gone over to Ker som\[CloseCurlyQuote]s again,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
guswered the deacon. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]She went yes-

Pretty Rhoda's fave got a5 rosy as the
Dossoms on the Damask rose-bush by
the gate. \[OpenCurlyQuote]Thy deacon wondered why he
had never moticed bow pretty she was
before. .

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]i see you'se got a fine crop of straw-
berries,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] suid Rhoda, pretending to be
greatly interested in the long rows of
ripening frult. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Outs ate a failure this
year. Mother suid she didn't believe
we'd have enongh fora shurteake.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote] want to know!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] exclaimed the dea-
econ, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Ehat\[CloseCurlyQuote]s too bad, ldeciare, We'll
hate more theo we can nse, and Wi
ring you over some just as soon as
theyre ripe enough to pick.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Thank you ever so much,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] responded
Rhode. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]E know mother\[CloseCurlyQuote] be glad to
get them, But ¥ must be going, or I
won't be back by dinner time,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and she
went her way, leaving the deacon with
& new idea in his head.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I spose folks would say it wag fool-
teh for an old fellow like me te marry
& young girl like Rhods,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he sail to
hiraself, as he tumed back on ihe next
tow of aweet corn. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Hult other men

deed, Lee got an arrangewent to that

through with his speech, but his fa-
ther\[CloseCurlyQuote]s was redder. He opened his mouth,
onee or twice, as if trying to say some-
thing, but worda would not come. Tt
wan well for him that the housekeeper
came in juet at this juncture. Rob
went out, and he betock himself to his
room to collect his bewilderrd senres,
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Well? deviare!" The pour deacon
dropped inte the first chair he cane to,
and sat aud atared at the bedpost for as
raaech as belf un hour, before Le began
to yret things straightened ont. 1
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]FE begin fo understand it,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he told
Nimeel? by and by. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I've come dreat-
fully near making 2 fool of myself.
¥ eness I did wake 2 fool of mgself,
nil righ? enongh, but what F mean fs,
leame dreadfully near getting cought
at It. But, be the preatext stroke of
tnek that ever happened to me,T haven't\[CloseCurlyQuote]

golng to marry Rhoda, aud he's been
sparking her all along, and the girt
thought T knew H. and she thinks it

it. ¥ didn't say anything that\[CloseCurlyQuote]) wive me

f . fate had something malo with it. F

never theusht of it before?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

The more the deacon thonght of it
the more iu earnest he got. On Satur-
day he plieked « baskit of Insctous
strawberries and that af.ernoanhe took
them over to the Mason homestead.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]} declare, if 1 ala't rather excited,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
said the deacon, a6 he neared Rhoda's
home, and felt his heart beating quick
and hard. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I thought I'd got over that
years ago. If L {eel this way now, how'll
Lfecl when Eget there? Of course, Pim
not going to propose to her right away,
VM just kind o° hint at matters and
things, enough to set her to thinking.
"Faint best to he fn too great a herry
Mhoat such things.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Rhoda was sitting on the front porch,
shelling peas, Pretty an rhe had looked
that morning in the roadside, she looked
far prettier to-day, the deavon thought.
