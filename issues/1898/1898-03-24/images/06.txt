GORN STALK DISEASE.

Solentiats Canmet Agree t pom Rte Stee
ture or ERect.

The farmers of Nebraska and lowa
\[OpenCurlyQuote]keen te have suffered mere from the
j Corn-stalk disense Chis season than ever

before, though comparatively few cases

of it are reported in other states.

Dy. Poters, of the Nebraska esperi-
| ent station, experiinented with cattle
iis order ta leurn the exact nature of

the disease and his conciusions were

that a renieds may be found in feeding

& grain ration instead of feeding stalks

exclisively.

This enncluxion has heen negatived
by the experience of John N. Garth, of
Webster City, In. as related in a loeat

| paper.

Mr. Garth bas been feeding his cat+
ue shock corn. They have had access
to water and salt ull the time. They
were turned info a stalk fehl one hour
the first day; two hours the second day,
nad the third day tive of them died.
This case sets at naught the «mut the
ory, the impacted stomach theory and

negntives the conclusions of Dr. Peters.

The goretnment has been investigat-
ing the disease for four or five vears,
but no definite remedy has been discor-
ered. If the discase is not increasing, it
is attracting more general attention
) than ¢ver, and farmers soon will becume
Lafraid to turn their cattle into stalk
! fields where a tuystenions death lurks.
The consensus of opinion ls that corn
istalks preserved in a silo never serve
| te introduce the disease. If thix
proved to be a fact we may look f
large iucrense in the number of silos
in the corn belt in the near foture. This

| wonld add to the talue.of the corn crop
and improve its feeding qualities.
