A

isa paper printed for the purpose of circulating the
news, and to keep the public informed as to what
is going on about them. There are many different
classes of newspapers --daily, semi-weekly and
weekly, ete., etc., but all are published for some
particular class of people or in the interest of some
particular locality except the great city dailies.
They are issued from perfecting presses and scatter
the news gleaned by cable and telegraph from all
over the world. While you are sleeping thousands
of men and women are busy as bees preparing the
papers you read the following day. Theyicover a
wide field of usefulness and are read by all classes
of people--the farmers, grain and stock dealers
read them for the markets, and almost every class
of people read them, but they can only notice such
news as is of almost universal interest, but

The Home
Paper

Occupies a different position. entirely. It is pub-
lished in the interest of a particular people and
should notice the coming and going, health and
happiness of the people of its locality. When
there is happiness in your family it is happy with
you--when there is sorrow it extends a word of
sympathy; in fact it is always with you and is ever
ready to aid in anything that will further the inter-
ests of the people in general. It should be in
every home, for how can you keep in touch with
your neighbors unless you know what is going on,
Not every person has the time to find out all these
things for himself--that is the business of the
hewspaper--we find the news and print i so that
you may sit by your fireside and contemplate the
doings of the day.

The :
Findlay :
Enterprise

Is published in the interest of the people of Findlay

The price is nominal and so low that no family can
afford to be without it. Are you a regular reader?

sent friend you may have it thirteen weeks for
