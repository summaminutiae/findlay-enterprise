te work, because work only increases the pain.

This is only one symptom of a chain of
troubles; she has others she cannot bear to
confide to her physician, for fear of

sitive, modest women,

The physician, meantime, knows
her condition, but cannot combat her
He yields to her
supplication for something to relieve
the pain. He gives her a few mor-
phine tablets, with very prave cau-
tion as to their use. Foolish wo-
min! She thinks morphine will
help her sight along; she becomes its slave!

A wise and a gencrous physician had such
acase; he told his patient he could do nothing
for her, as she was tov nervous to undergo
an examination. In despair, she went to
visit a friend. She said to her, * Don't give
yourself up; just po to the nearest drugpist\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
and buy a bottle of Mons. Lydia FE. Pinkham\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Vegetable Compound.
Tt will built you up. You will begin to feel better with the first
bottle.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] She did so, and after the fifth bottl: her health was re
established. Here is her own letter about it:

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I was very miserable; was so weak that ¥
could hardly get around the house, could not do
any work without feeling tired out. My monthiy
periods had stopped and I was so tered and nerv-
ous all of the time. I was troubled very much with
falling of the womb and bearing-down pains. A
friend advised me to take Lydia E. Pinkham\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
Vegetable Compound; I have taken five bot-
tles, and think it is the best medicine { eves
i used. Now I can work, and feel bike myself,
% I used to be troubled greatly with my head,
but I have had no bad headaches or palpitas
| tion ul the heart, womb trouble or bearin down pains, since f coms
menced te take Mrs, Pinkham\[CloseCurlyQuote]s medicine. | gladly recommend the
Vegetable Compound to every suffcring woman. The use of one
bottle will prove what it can do.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]"--Mrs. Lucy Peasiev, Desby,
