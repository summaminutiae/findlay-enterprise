No, the case would have to go over for

would teach his contrary brother the
needed lesson in time.

In th. dark days of 61 three brothers
responded to I'resident Lingoin\[CloseCurlyQuote]s eail
for troops. They came from a quiet
farm home in one of the northern eonn-
ties of Indiana, All of them left home
for the battefields with a mother's
blessingon their heads, but the mother's
heart went out especially to the young-
est, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]her baby.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He was bute boy of 19
to whom the hard work of the farm had
alwaye beeh more of a Burden than his
frail bods could bear, and for that rea-
30n he was made much of by the other
members of the family. But men were
neaded, her sons thought tt their place
to go, and it was not her part to stand

try.

"Month after month wore away, The
mother watched anxiously for each
muil, and was occasionally rewarded
with a letter. always from \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]her baby_\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
