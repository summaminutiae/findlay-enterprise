\[OpenCurlyQuote]Br. Gladstone Asd been unconscious prac-
all day, though at times he seemed
to recognive for a moment come of the

Watchers about him. Certainty he did rec- |

egnize his wife, who was beside him al! day
except when the physician prevailed upon
her to reat. She tenderly claxped her hut-
band's hand ae she watched him. Appar-
ently he slept @ good deat; occasionally he
uttered a few words In an inecoherer:,
areamy way, words which those who were
Watching wers unable to cateh, Their only

consolation was that he was noi suffering -

Pain, No nercotics were administered.
Though a national funeral will prob-
a@biy be gecepited by the famMy, there is
Kittle doubt that the remains of Mr. Glad-
Stone will be laid to rest in the peaceful
Graveyard of Hawarden adjoining the
thurch where he wav married more \[OpenCurlyQuote]thar
