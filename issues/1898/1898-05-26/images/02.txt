THE EXCELLENCE @F SYRUP OF Res

is due not only to the originality and
simplicity of the combination, but also
tothe care and skill with which it is
manufactured by scientifie processes
known to the Canirorsta Fig Syaup
Co. only, and we wish to impress upon
all the importance of purchasing the
true and original remedy. As the
genuine Syrup of Pigs is manufectured
by the Catironnta Fira Sravr\[CloseCurlyQuote] Oo.
ouly, a knowledge of that fact will
assist one im avokling the worthless
imitations manufactured by other par
ties. The high standing of the Caxi-
Foussa Fia Syucr Co. with the medi-
eal profession, and the satisfaction
which the genuine Syrup of Figs has
given to millions of families, makes
the name of the Company a guarenty
of the excellence of its remedy. It is
far in advance of ali other laxatives,
as it, acta on the kidneys, liver and
bowels without or weaken-
ing them, and it does not gripe nor
nauseate. In order to get its beneficial
effects, please remember the name of
the Company --
