Newspaper

is a paper printed for the purpose of circulating the
news, and to keep the public informed as to what
is going on abont them. \[OpenCurlyQuote]There are many different
elasses of newspapers--daily, semi-weekly and
weekly, etc., etc., but all are published for some
particular class of people or in the interest of some
particular locality except the great city dailies.
They are issued from perfecting presses and scatter
the news gleaned by cable and telegraph from all
over the world, While you are sleeping thousands
of men and women are busy as bees preparing the
papers you read the following day. They cover a
wide field of usefulness and are read by all classes
of people--the farmers, grain and stock dealers
read them for the markets, and almost every class
of people read them, but they can only notice such
news as is of almost universal interest, but

The Home
Paper

Occupies a different position entirely. I¢ is pub-
lished in the interest of a particular peaple and
should notice the coming and going, health and
happiness of the people of its locality. When |
there is happiness in your family it is happy with
you--when there is sorrow it extends a word of |
sympathy; in fact it is always with you and js ever |
ready to aid in anything that will further the inter-|

It should be in|

ests of the people in general.
every home, for how can you keep in touch with }
your neighbors unless you know what is going on.
Not every person has the time to find out all these |
things for himself--that is the business of the
newspaper--we find the news and print it so that

yon may sit hy your fireside and contemplate the |

doings of the day.

The
Findlay
