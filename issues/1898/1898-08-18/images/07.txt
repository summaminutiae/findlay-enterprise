Speak to-day about the ruinous modes
of getting money.

Inall our city, state and autional
elections large sunys of money are used
in bribery. Politics, from being the
Science of good goyerument, has often
been bedragyled into the synonym for
trucuivocy and tarpitude. A monster
sin, plausible, potent, pestiferous, has
@one forth to do its drendful work in
all ages, Its two hands are rotten

with lepresy. I% keeps ite right lod

hidden in @ deep pocket. The left
hand is clenched, and with its ichorous
Iknuckie it taps at the door of the court
room. the legisiative hall, the congress
Bndthe parliament. The door swings
open anil the monster enters and glides
through the isle of the council chau

for trial. :

The Bible arraigna t again ant

who became jiniyes: *\[CloseCurlyQuote]Phey took bribes

of some of his pursuers: \[OpenCurlyQuote]Their right
