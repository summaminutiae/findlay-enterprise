From a Young Wife.

What a disappoint-
ment then to see the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]f
fair young wife's beauty f
fashoy away before ayéar

fect as it lwould like to
Say te every youne woman who is about
to be marricadl --" Strengthen yourself in
advance, so that you will not break down
under the new strain on your powers.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
Keep your beauty, it is a precious pous-
session! Your husband loves your beauty, @

he 15 proud to be seen in public with you; try to keep it for his sake,
and your own.

The pale checks, the dark shadows under the eyes, the general
drooping: of the young wife's form, what do they mean? They
mcan that her nerves are failing, that her strength is going and that
somethin, musi be done to help her through the coming trials of
Maternity.

Built her up at once by a course of some tonic with Specific pow.
ers. Such as Lydia E. Pinkham\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Vegetable Compound. Yau can
get tat any drupreist's.

Following: we publish by request a letter from a young. wife--of
her own accord she addresses it to her \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]suffering sisters,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and while
from modesty she asks to withhold her name, she pives her initials
and street number in Chambersburg, Pa., so she can casily be found
personally or by letter:

To my Suffering Sisters:--Let me write this for your benefit, tell-
ing you what Lydia E. Pinkham's Vezetable Compound has done
forme. Tam but nineteen and suffered with painful menstruation,
leucorrhiea, dizziness, burning sensation back of ears and on top of
my head, nervousness, pain and soreness of muscles, bearing-dowa
pains, could\[CloseCurlyQuote] not sleep well, was unable to stand without Pain, and
oh! how @longed to be well!

One day I wrote to Mrs, Pinkham telling her all, knowing 3 could
do so in perfect confidence.

She wrote me a lovely letter in reply, telling me exactly what te
do. After taking nine bottles of the Compound, one box of Liver
Pills, and using one-half package of Sanative Wash, f can say Iam
cured. Iam so happy, and owe my happiness to none other than
Mrs. Pinkham.

Why will women suffer when help isnear? Let me, as one who
bas had experience, urge all suffering women, especially young
wives, to seck Mrs. Pinkham\[CloseCurlyQuote]s advice.--Mrs. R. Ss. BR, 13 E
