AIDED BY MRS. PINKHAM.

Mrs. W. EB. Paxros, Youngtown,
North Dakota, writes about her strar-
gle to regain health after the birth of
her little gir);

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]DEAE Mus. Prsxusm---It is with
pleasmre that I add my testimony to
Four list, hoping that it may induce
others to avail themselyes of your val-
uable medicine,

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]After the birth of my litle eirl,
three years ago, my health was very
poor. I had jencorrhas badly, and a
terrible besring<iown pain which
gradually grew worse, until IL could do
no work. Also had headache nearly
all the time, and dizzy feelings. Moen-
Strontions were very profuse, appear-
ing every two weeks.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Etook medicine from @ good doctor,
but it seemed to do no good. I was
becoming alarmed over my condition,
when E read your aivertisement in a
paper. I sent at once for a bottle af
Lydia E. Pinkham\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Vegetable Com-
ponnd, and after taking two-thirds of
the bottle I felt so much better that I
Send for two more. After using three

bottles I feltias strong and well as any
one,

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]think itisthe best medicine for
female weakness ever advertised, and
Feeommend it to every lady I meet suf-
fering from this trouble.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Maternity is a wonderful experience
and many women approach it wholly
woprepared. Childbirth under right

} contitions need not terrify women.

her advice is berond question the most
