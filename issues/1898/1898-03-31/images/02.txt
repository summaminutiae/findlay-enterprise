Hopeful Words to Childless Women.

The darkest days of husband and wile are when they come to lock forrard
to « chililess and desolate old age. :

Many a wife has found herself incapable of
motherhood owing to some great lack of
strength in the orvansef generation. Such a
condition is nearly always due to long con-
tinued neylect.of the plainest warnings.

Frequent tuckache and distressing pains
accompanied by offensive discharges
nnd generally byirregularand seanty
menstraation, indicate a nerve de-

$

ruiniling oreans, that unless speedily
@becked will resu}t im barrenness.

Read Mrs. Wilson's letter:

Deas Mus. Po\[OpenCurlyQuote]xnam:--Noonecould f
have suffered from female troubles
more than Z. £ had tomors on the
worub, my Ovaries were diseased,
and for fifteen years f was a burden
to myself. I was operated epon
three different times, with only
temporary relief; also tried
manydortors. Lydia E. Pink-
hain\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Vegetable Compound
was recommended to me by &
lady friend, and after taking
four bottles I was like a new wo-
man. i hed been married nine
vvars, and had nochildren, ¥ now

feel assured she is the result of my taking the
Compound.--May EK. Wirses, 323 Sassafras

Modern science and pest experiences hare produced so effective im.
trvating diseases of the female organs as Lydia ©. Pinkham\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Vegetable Come-
pound and Sanative Wash used according to special directions.

if you know any woman who is suffering and who is unebie to secure relief,
or who is sorrawfal because she believes herself barten, tell her to write te,
Mrs. Pinkham, et Lyan, Mass., and ask her advice, The thousands of Mrx§
