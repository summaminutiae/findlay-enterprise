And what an innovation to any-
thing that has ever been shown
in Findlay. In selecting the stock
I have spared no pains or money.
in the selection of the most desir-
able clothing that could be found
in the markets. That my stock
contains just what the people
want is evidenced by the number
of pleased customers that have
already left the store. The stock
comprises everything in

Men\[CloseCurlyQuote]s and Bays Clothing,

Furnishing Goods, Hats, Gaps,
Jewelry, Neckwear, Efe,

Everything in the store is new
and are marked at prices that will
sell them. I now extend to one
- and alla hearty invitation to come
to the store and examine the stock
-come in and look at goods that
are within the reach of all. I will
accord to each and every customer
the same courteous treatment and
the same low prices.
