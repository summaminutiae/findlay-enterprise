Newspaper

is a paper printed for the purpose of circulating the
¢ news, and to keep the public informed as to what
is going on about them. There are many different
classes of newspapers--daily, semi-weekly and
weekly, etec., ete., but all are published for some
particular class of people or ia the interest of some
particular locality except the great city dailies.
