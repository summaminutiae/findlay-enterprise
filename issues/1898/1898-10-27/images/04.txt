Out of
the World
ssoor Fashion !

There is nothing that adds so materially to the
appearance ofa well-dressed lady as a tastefully trimmed
hat--one trimmed so as to harmonize with her features
and in colors that are in keeping with her age and
station. lt takes years of careful study to accomplish
this, and if you buy your hat at Mrs. Dickson's you
get the benefit of this experience.

I have just returned from the city where 1 selected &
by far the nicest and most éomplete line of fashionable ¢
millinery and headwear for ladies, Misses and children
ever brought to Findlay. Comte in and see.
