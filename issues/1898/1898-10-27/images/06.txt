ECONOMY IN HOG KILLING,

As this is the season when hog Killing
is most common it ls worth while\[CloseCurlyQuote] to re-
mind those who haye irut one or two or
even three hogs to KH! that it fs far
cheaper to take these where a larger
punwber are to be slaughtered, and where
there are all the convenlemees than te kill
the hogs at home, says the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Froit Grow-

weiter and getting ready generally fake a
good deal of time. When this is done, the
work of killing an@ dressing requires
comparatively little It is far better for
fsrmers te co-operate in this work than
in any other we know. Buch farmer who
has only a few hoge to kill can have this
job done for him much cheaper as well
as more cacily than he can do tt for tim-
self.
