Soap-heredity.

Women who use soap don't do so because they
know it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s the best. Probably they haven't
given a thought to the matter, They
inherit the soap-habit--their mothers and
orandmothers did, before them.

Bi \[OpenCurlyQuote]Women who use Pearline do so,
i \\ & because they have used soap and
Pearline, and have found Pearline to be better--more
efiective, saving time and rubbing; just as harmless, and
more economical.
