& Splewdid Yocord.

Hon. J. W. ¥autis, of Shelbyville
county, who is 4 caudidate for the gen-
eral assemble from the divtrict of which
Bhelby ia a part, hus made « pleated
reeord for the opportanitics afforded
him heretofore ly the democrney of his
section, and he desarves well of the ater-
Hing democrate of that district. He is
earnest in hie conviction af party primeci-
ples, aud iq eggressive im hie demands
for the vights of his party endl his
dredtuls.

Mr. Yantia is one of the few that took
the initiative for bimetalliom when the
federal administration aud other gold-
bug influences were endervoring to
force the gold standard doctrine upon
the democracy of the nation, He shoo
firm for this declaration when if was
scoffed at end lackal the populerity
which it pow enjoys. He wan revog-
nized us champion of free coimage of
silyer early in the fray, and whe 90-
leotadl as delegate to Washington, D. C.,
to gilvance the came of free silver
prior to the mecting of the connty and
gigts convention which dc¢larat for
both silver aud wohl at the rate of 16
to 1.

Washingtow was thea the very hot
bed of goldbngiam, and it hed weak
ening effect on the anior of many of
typ irieods of silver at the that tine; bat
in contradiction to the reports that
Were thon being given out by Senator
Poimer; Comptrotier Eckley and Ben
Cable, then Lilinois member af the ne-
tidual democratic committee Mr. Yan-
tig ig quoted in the Washington Povt
in April, 2805, as saying :

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Tho Wilinois democracy sre irrevn-
ently committed to the silver cause,
and in our etate convention on June 6,
there will be s declaration in fever of
the white metal at a ratio of 18 to I~
i & of the action of foreign
governments. The people ure tired of
riding longer with the question. They

}know what they want, and ere guing
to express ves With mo wneer-
tain sound.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] :

This apeake volumes for the earnest-
nese of Mr. Vantin\[CloseCurlyQuote] comvintions. It is
peasy to be for anything that hae al-
ready been acted upon, and that has
proved to be popular, but Mr. Yantia
defined his position in advance of re-
conled netion. Many who are not
wholly converted gre forced into line
by popalar ventiment; lot Mr. Tantia
helped to moukl and encourage popu-
lar sentiment. in favor of bimetalliam.
It is glwsys safe ta depeml upon a
man's sincerity when he leads out and
stemis for wm principle in neal of sup-
pert. ;

Mr. Yentis hasshown marked ability
in the diwharge of pulilie dnativs, end
has at all times fonght valliantly for
that which waa best for the common
people, Hiv efforts seenred greater
reductions in assessments, mot only in
Shelhy county, but in every county in
hin dintrict, than have ever been made
before or since he filled the offive of
member of the state hoard of «juali-
tation, aod although large inereaues
in the assessments of Couk county were
chargeable to his efforts he was meyer
qeeused, even by his enemies, of bring
corrupt.

Fhe State Reginter hopes that the
deqocracy of Hlinois will wend men

from every dintrict who are ss trae fo |

the findemental doctrines enunciated
hy the Chicogo platform and cham-
pioned during the last campaign by
Willian J. Bryan, as ia Mr. Yantis.

ald Shelby will moke no mixtake im en-
dorsing him for reminatim,--THliaois
