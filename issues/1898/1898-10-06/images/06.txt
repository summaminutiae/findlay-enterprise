fresh to the pleasures of their calling.

He had reason to be glait of his pre-
vaution. for he bad not been there long
when he heard laughter and yoires
that he recognized as belonging te his
nephews and Miss Kitty. They were
coming toward him, and he Rad just
time to dart ont, seize the watch and
hide aguin, Lefore they came in sight.

Miss Vail dutifully warmed her eyes
earthward. Presently she gave an ex-
elatuation of surprise as she came
upon the watch, lying face up and tick-
ing cheerfally. She picked it up and
examined if closely.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What a pity that some one shoud
have lost euch @ beautiful watch!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] she
said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]There ere no initials om it,

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Oh, &£ shail advertise, of course,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Mr, Reade stepped short. Te have

dismayed him. It was mot for Kitty
that he bad lad the watch made, aud

Mr. Reale breathed again.

Bald.

His satisfaction increased as Miss
Vail fixed the watch in the front of her
ilress. They continued their walk and
siw the rare plants. Mr. Reade became
inst Lively and entertaining.

That evening John and James held a
congratulatory meotng fm tne study.
Ther scheme was under way, at all
events: the pext thiag was to reap tbe
Peeits.

John new began to be more specific
in hix auientions to Miss Vail.

Personal feelings overcame acientific -

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Then there ie nothing to do but to
try elation once more. If pou wish, t

But on this point he met 2a de

undertook, and started hpon it early
the next day.

He was gone piost of the morning,
bur he was unable to give John mach
information wher he got back.

to go ta see Miss Vail im the after-

noon. James applauded the deter~ - *

mination, as the watch would have leas
opportunity of being knfiuemced by
other events which might arise in the
meantime.

My. Reade thought that James\[CloseCurlyQuote] talk
tight have put new idess inte Miss
Vatl's head and thet she might im con-
sequences treat bim diteremily, hut he
was mistaken. She was precisely the
same, and he saw that he should Rave
to depend solely upom science. He
seized the firat opportunity te ask it he
shold jook at the watch. Miss Veil
banded it te hina with a laugh.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]See.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] she sai, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]hasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]c it beem be-
having shocklagty? \[OpenCurlyQuote]That is----\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

But Mr. Reade was not iistesing. He
was staring at the watch. it was an
howr and three-quarters akead of time!

Surely su one neet desire mora en-
couragement than that! She must have
been yery much overjoyed at what
James had sald for such an effect ea
this to have been produced. In viewgut
such convincing proofs of her affectlon
he would heaitate ao longer.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Then you do love me, Mise Marga-
ret!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] be excinimed. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Wil you marry
me?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

ft was much simpler to accomplish
than he had expected. it is tree, Miss
Vail was somewhat startied, but ake
recavered her composure with com-
mendable promptitude and assented,
with a decided twinkle in her eyas:

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Yes, | will and § do; but how did
you ever find it ont?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] = ©

He did nat tell her just that minute,
but inter he repeatel the history of the
watch to her, full of pride and pleas-
nre in the smccess of his scientific
conrtship, He did not understand why
the twinkle in Miss Vail\[CloseCurlyQuote]a eyes in-
creased until there was too much twin-
kle to be confined there, and it ex-
tended 19 her mouth as well and mage
dimples that were out of all keeping
with so learned a subject. When he
had finished she said:

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What a dear, stupid goose you are?
f have been positively finging myself
at your head for the last month.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] ;

And thea. with another burst of
me \[OpenCurlyQuote]riment which Mr. Reade found in-
fecvtious even before he knew the
enuse:
