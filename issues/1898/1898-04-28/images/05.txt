Newspaper

Is a paper printed for the purpose of circulating the

news, and to keep the public informed as to what
is going on about them. There are many different

classes of newspapers--daily, semi-weekly and
weekly, ete., ete, but all are published for some
particular class of people or in the interest of some
particular locality except the great city dailies.

They are issued from perfecting presses and scattc
the news gleaned by cable and telegraph from 4!
over the world. While you are sleeping thousand;

of men and women are busy as bees preparing the

papers you read the following day.

They cover a

wide field of usefulness and are read by all classes

of people--the farmers, grain and stock dealers

read them for the markets, and almost every class

of people read them, but they can only notice such
news as is of almost universal interest, but

The Home
Paper

Occupies a different position entirely. It is pub-

lished in the interest of a particular people and

should notice the coming and going, health and

happiness of the people of its locality.

When

there is happiness in your family it is happy with

you--when there is sorrow it extends a word of

sympathy; in fact it is always with you and is ever

ready to aid in anything that will further the inter-

ests of the people in general. Ie should be in

every home, for how can you keep in touch with

your neighbors unless you know what is going on.

Not every person has the time to find out all these

things

for himself--that is the business of the

newspaper--we find the news and print it so that

you may sit by your fireside and contemplate the

doings of the day.

The

Findlay
bnterprise

Is published in the interest of the people of Findlay

and surrounding country and it endeavors to print

all the news of Findlay and surrounding country

in a readable manner.

In it you will find nothing

sensational--nothing impure, but a plain and truth-
