LATE WAR NEWS.

VESSELS CAPTURED BY OUR SEAMEN.

Some Late Dispatches Briefly Chronicled for
our Readers.

COULD SINK POWERFUL SHIPS.

Loxpox, April 26.--Spain has acquired the lease of a
vessel called a submarine wonder, which was invented by
Count Pozzo and constructed in France. The vesselis a
steel sphere, with an external diameter of nine feet and nine
inches. She is propelled by electricity, and has a speed of
cight or nine knots an hour. She carries a supply of com-
pressed air that will last three men for 48 hours. From the
front of the vessel protrudes astrong cutting and grappling

arm, which is capable of severing anchor cables and con- } =

nections of submarine mines. She can lay mines and dis-
charge them electrically after retiring to a safe distances.
She can be connected with the deck of a vessel and so guide
a warship safely through mined waters.

Mr. Ackerman, London agent of the owners, says that
the boat is on board of a Spanish vessel that is now five
days out for the United States. It is expected that she
will give a practical demonstration of her yaluc in New
Fork harbor in a very short time.

troops, is beginning to present amillitary aspect. By to-
morrow noon over $%,o00 soldiers of the MMlinois National
Guard will be ia camp there in response to the eall. This
will be the largest body of armed men assembled here since
the civil war. After several rainy days, the boys are fay-
ored with perfect weather, aud indications are that it will so
continne,

Some of the various commands began arriving this after-
noon. All are to be in camp by noon tomorrow, Adjutant
General Reeee and inspector General Van Cleave were at

Three Opinions:

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The CHICAGO RECORD is a model
newspaper in every sense of the wa
Harrisburg (Pa.) Call.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]There is no paper published in America
that so nearly approaches the true onal
istic ideal as The CHICAGO RECORD,
From \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Newspaperdom" (New York).

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]d have come te the firm conclusion, after
& long test and after a wide comparison
with tie journals of many cities and coun-
tries, that The CHICAGO RECORD comes
as near being the ideal daily journal as we
are for some time likely to flad on these
morial shores."\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]"--Prof. J. F. Hatfield in
The Evanston (1i.) Index.
