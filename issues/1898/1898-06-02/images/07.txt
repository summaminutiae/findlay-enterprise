Rev. T. De
following sermon, aliresses himself to

those who loquacionsly try to- comfort

Beople in trouble. The text is:
Minerable comforters bre ye al---Job xvb 2,
The man of Ux had agrest many

trials--the fuss of his fainiiv, the loss

of his property, the loss of hiy liwalth;

but the most exasperating thing that
fame upon him was the tantalizing
tulk of thuse who ought to have sym.
pathized with him. And looking
Sround upon them, and weighing what
they had said, he Ulters the words of

My text.

Thatis the place where such quass-
tions will be answered and such niys-
ite who this side that
river attcmpty to answer the question
only iMustrates his own ignorance aud
ineompemncy. All I know is one
reat fact. and that is, that a herd of
Woes has come ik tipon us, tranipling

Tremark, in the first place, that very
voluble people are incompetent for the
work of giving eomfort. Bildad and
Gliphaz had the giftof lunaguage and
With their words almost bothered Job's

plethat go among the houses of the
atilieted, acd talk, and talk, and talk,
and talk. \[OpenCurlyQuote]fhey rehearse their own
sorrows, und then they tell tbe poor
aufferers that they feel badly aviv, but
they will feel worse after awhile.
Silence! Do vou expect with « thin
eourt-plaster of words to heal a wound
deep as the sutti? Step very gently
@rouad about a broken heurt. Talic

Was found in the pasture field with his
arms fround 2 hotse\[CloseCurlyQuote]s neck, caressing
him. and some one suid: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Why, the
§teat mam has lost his mind.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] No. the
horses belonged to his son, who had re-
cently died; and his great heart broke
over the grief. Itis me sign of weakk-

David did well when he mourned for
Absalom; Abraham did well when ke

to see come anywhere near me when I

Again I remark that those persons
are incompetent for the work of come

cant to offer. There are those who
have the idea thet yon must groan over

Palin the home after the day's work fe
done, and the was isturned on and the
