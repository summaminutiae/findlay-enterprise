| The People
Who Are Open
To Conviction,

And will trade where

the people we cater to; the people who know

they can do best are

the value of a dollar; the people who want
and are entitled to the big dollar's worth;
the people who are open to reason; the peo-
ple who want honest goods at honest prices:
the people who expect their MONEY BACK
if they are not satisfied; the people who
want to SAVE MONEY always get satis-
faction at our store.

You can be convinced by giving us ag

trial.
