Later Than Vaual,

Never before this year did County
Clerk Small get the returns from the
secretary of state showing the equal-
itation later than Getober 18. This
year the returns were withheld with
the evident intention of influenving the

tuction of 11 per cent on lands im Shel-

been so outrageously high under Tan-!
nerivm that they feared to send it ont |
till after election. Clerk Small is hur-
tying the tax books through so the
collectors can get them in time: and
besides, Mr. Smail wishes to have all
the clerk's books turned over to hin
knheoessar written up todate. Hoe hea
to help him---Homer A. Smail, John
Raff, Ed Stonehurner, Tom Miner and
