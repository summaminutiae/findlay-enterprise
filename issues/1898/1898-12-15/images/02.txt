: Archduchess Elizabeth of Ans-

through here om their wey to
Madrid, where their presence is

owing to the serious condition of
the health of her Spanieh Majesty.
She hes suffered terribly from the
fsightful strain of responsibility
throughout the recent war, as well
a8 in connection with the amxious
negotiations that both preceded

and followed the conflict.

Probably no one has taken
Spain's defext so deeply to heart
as the Queen Regent, her aahier
tude for the land of ner adoption
ss being further increased by her
p fears of involving the sacrifice of
the throne of hee son. Her health
has repeatedly broken down dur-
\[OpenCurlyQuote]ing the present year, but sbe has
never been able to give herself
either the cure or the reat necessary
for tts restoration, and has \[OpenCurlyQuote]e
mained at Medrid throughout the
unbealthy and terribly trying
summer, Until now she has
always been accustomed to sper
the hot months on the seashore at
San Sebastian. Her health has
now, however, completely given
Way, and her physicians invist that
it is imperative that she should
seek rest jn some foreign country,
where the utsnost quietude, relax-|
ation and freedom from cane sud
worry would be assured. Other-
wine the medical authorities will

not answer for the consequences.
