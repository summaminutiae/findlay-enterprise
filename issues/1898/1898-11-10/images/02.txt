FARM NOTES AND VIEWS.

The farmer who does not believe
that farming pays can alwaye find
other farmers who make a profit. The
real drawhack to farming is conipeti-
tion, which the farmer mnst meet as
well as the tradesman. The compett-
tor of the farmer ig some other farmer
who fs more progressive than he. No
farmer who keeps cows that produces
only three pounds of butter per week
can compete with one whoze cows give
twice or three times as muck prefit,
and the ones who do not keep up with
the march of improvement will fall far
behind. Time on the farm cannct be

wasted, hence @ farmer cannot affora --%
to wait two or thtee years watching ©
his nelghbor make experiments, but
must himself go ahead and get tox

fr as Boon AS possible. There is
str competition among farmers.
Some can produce at a lower cost thay
others and can consequently selt ar
lower prices. To meet this competition
each farmer must resort to the bast
stock to be had and keep his farm up

to the standard of fertility.

ly on its mérits, A dairyman who gete

there is siways a demand for \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]choice.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Some dairymen get 60 eonis per pound
for their butter the whole year, the
ruling market price not affecting it.
as it sells strictly on quality.

The best way to sell buttermik,

\[OpenCurlyQuote] fekim-inilk and whey is to create a mar-

ket for it at home inetead of hauling it
to the railroad to be shipped and sela
ing. To do this the farmer should
Rave a sufficient number of piga to
eonsume the waste products from Bie
@airy. Bran and buttermilk will pay ie
the form of pork.

Blackberries have sold at prices thie
year which did not pay for picking
them. The wet days about the latter
part of July softened the berries and
damaged them. On the other a;
there has been an excellent d@
for curranta and gooseberries, and
these frults should be more extensively
cultivated. It is being demonstrateé
that such perishable articles as sma}!
fruits should be shipped in refrigere-
tor cars and mere distant marketer
from the localities of growth ahould be
sought. While some of the Eastera
markets were abundantly supplied last
month, otter markets had no supply.

it is not safe to trust even the gen-
tle horses during this season, as fier
annoy them terribly. They must sever
be left unfastened, as they will start
off in order to avoid the pests, being
more comfortable when in motion,
even when drawing a load, than whee
standing and attacked by large num-
bers of flies,

During the past two weeks there
have been frequent showers, wi
have been of incalculable benefit to
weeds. August and September are the
best months in the year for the growth
of weeds, and a week's time wii} show
wonderful advancement of the pests.
Bome of them will quickty reach Ghe  ,
seed-ripening stage, and there shoul& «
be no delay in getting rid of them,
either by cultivating the ground or by
mowing down those that are in @d-
vanced growth. if plowed under when
green they are excellent additions te
the soil, but if any of them approacs
geed bearing they should be burnt at
spon as dry. Farmers will find plenty
of work this month if they wish $e
prevent weeds from seeding.
