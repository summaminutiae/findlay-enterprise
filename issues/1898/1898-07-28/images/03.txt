A Valk With Mrs. Pinkham About the Cause
of Ancmia.

Everybody comes into this world with a predisposition to disease
of some particular tissue; in other words, every body hasa weak spot.

Not more than one woman in a hundred--aay,
perfectly healthy organs of
R gencration. This points

soon as tire life powers
seem to be on the wane,

Excessive menstsua-

cal weakness and want
of tone in the uterine
organs. &t saps the
strenjth away and pro-
duces anemia (blood

Hf vou become anemic, there is no knowing what will happen. If
your guns and the inside of your lips and inside your eyelids looks
pale in color, you are in a dangerous way and must stop that drase
on your powers. Why not build up on a generous, uplifting tonic,
like Lydia E. Pinkham\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Vegetable Compound?
