RELIABILITY

is a quality com mewspapers have Inet sight of te these
days of \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]yeow\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] fourmalism,

and a great deal for semporary sensation,

it is not so with THE CHICAGO REQORD,

The success of THE RECORD rests mpon its reliability,

i prints the mews--all the mews--and tells the truth
about it,

It is the omly American mewspaper outside New York city
that has its own exclusive dispatch boat service and its
own staff correspondents and astisis at the front in botis
hemispheres.

Ik is the hest Whestrated daily wewspaper in the world.

Us war news service is unappeoschallly the oest.

Says fle Urbana (08) Daily Coster:
