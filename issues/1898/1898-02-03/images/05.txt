ego he was standing down near Masonic
Temple, when a private watchman told
him that burglars were getting into a
house near the Presbyteriaoa checch, a
block away. 2t was un awful bad
wight, ned the rain was just coming
down in a hurry. The officer rap xp to
the place, and ¢hrowiag awar iis rab-
ber coat ran up the dark alley, where
the burglars had scaled a Lich brick
wull. Without sending for assistance
the officer, who was ambitions to make
an arrest unaided, climbed over the wil
and dropped down into the dark vard.
As he did so he struck fis cuce on a
lew fence om the insiie and gave it u
eprain from which he did yet recover
for three months.

ecelved several telegrams from Havana
concerning the death of the insurgent
leader Avanguten. They are from See-

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]There is scarcely a week withont
pome sort of crank coming here to get
imaginary treasures, but they are ueur-
Ty ali hapasiess fellows, with soft brains.
Nevertheless, it is wise and proper that
the president should olways be guarded.
Besides the men in citizen's dress, there
are alwayxe several met in uniform cut-

that any dangerous man would go past

there are officers ontsile, within easy
