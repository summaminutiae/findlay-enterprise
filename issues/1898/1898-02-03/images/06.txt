& WOMAN'S LITTLE GAME

BY CHARLES &, Lmwin

(Copyright, R036.}

E wish you to understand from the
very outset of thin story that [ am an
@i bachelot. I can say without ego-
@ism that I could have placed the yoke
of matrimony over my neck a score of
times tciween the ages of 2) and 46,
bur Idd not elect too so, It seemed
@ great deal better to keep my liberty,
and to fa} in love with a new face about
once & month. A bachelur can do thie,
you krow, while a macricd man is
bouck by certain ties pot casily broken.

Up to the time 2B was apywinted war-
\[OpenCurlyQuote]des of the Keswick prisan I had been
im love just 48 times. That wes an
average of twiee a xear, which T think
