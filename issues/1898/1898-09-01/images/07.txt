\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]TALKED ABOUT.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

The neighbors talked about her nearly
everywhére they met.

They talked about her ti) she aled; they
talk about her yes.

\[OpenCurlyQuote]The high ard tow ali spoke of her, as did
the old and young,

And every gossiy toased her namic upon her
cimble tongue.

She always kep: a-doing things, by night
aS well aa das,

To set the tonguea a-going In the swiftest
B0rt of Wey;

Across the tack-yard fences and from
kitthes door to door,

At church and sociable hername was whin-
dered o'er and o'er,

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Twas. she who kissed the baby first and
blest its happy birth;

"TWas she who helped to guide its feet
through all the paths of earth:

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Twas she who watched beside the bed

. Whereop the dying tay,

"Twos she #ho soothed the atncken friends

When one was called away.

\[OpenCurlyQuote]Th- neightors talked about her nearly
everswhere they met:

They tatked about her till ehe died: they
trek ahout her yet.

Thsy talked abuut her wondrous hands, her
heart so {gl of lave,

And cow the angels talk of her who dwells
wih them above.

THE FOLDING DOORS

By J. A. FLYNN.

$

HE ecolor-tone of Mrs. Haviland\[CloseCurlyQuote]s

mMuUsit-room 16 somber green,
Whilst the drawing-room is decorated
in merry pink. When her guests are
too serious or too frivolous, she
ebanges their mood by passing them
through the folding doors,

Upon the afternoon in question she
received me in the music-room; so my
usual gayety deserted me, and conver-
sation seemed to flag.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]T Iinve offen wondered,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] she snd,
suddenly, alter 1 had sighed three
times, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]why you quarreled with Thea
Lester, Forgive me for alluding to a
painful subject.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Oh--er--certainty,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] FT responded,
awkwardly. L didn't want to discuss

the subject, and I should probably have
found anes lo change it if Phad been
fortified by a pink environment,

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]fhe fact is, my dear Mrs. Haviland, f
didn't quarrel with her.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] My hostess
shook her pretty head.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t miean ta tell me that it
was Thea's fautt? 1 simply can't im-
agine her quarreling with anybody.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Of course she wouldn't. Lhat\[CloseCurlyQuote]s just
it)\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Then is outwardly placid. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Still
Life(TM) my irreverent youny sister used
to call her. Nevertheless, there are
charming depths within.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Then, if you dida't quarrel with her,
tind she didn't quarre) with you, how-
ever did you quarrel with one an-
ether?" i shook my head and looked
info the conservatory.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We didn't exuctly quarrel,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] F said.
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We thoupbt it better to part; at least,
that is what we anid.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Ah, welll Lam letting my curiositt
rup uway with me. We will talk of
something else. Coie, say. samething
seneusdn ge?"

T tried to think of something clever
to suy, but everything that came into
my head secmed trivisl or inappre-
priate, so 1 sighed forthe fourth time,

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It was thoaghtiess of me to raise
said memories,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said Mrs. Haviland,
gently. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You must forgive me, Mr.
Richmond. You see f am so interested
in you both.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] F bowed.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Roth in their respective ways ap-
precinte your kindacss, am snre.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]*
She is an excetient Hithe woman, whose
ouly weakness ts a manin for marry-
ing off her friends.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Lt wis in this Louse,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] she continued,
almost tearfully, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]in this very room, if
I am not mistaken, that you and
Thea----"

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Yes: it was.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] She left us alone for
two hours, the good little soal!

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You both gave me your confidence

--thent\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] She is one of those nive lit-

tle women whom every body confides in,

you know.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Keliove me, [ should confide in you
now, ff there were anything to von fide;
but there isn't.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] LE didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t want to talk
to anyone about it, cither.

She shook her head slowly. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]When
you talk ubout--it--as if it were a
wmere nothing, I know that you are not
$y earnest, Mr. Richmond,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] she:said, re-
proachfully.

Tiwirled my mustache uneasily, She
was evidently determined to know sii
about it, and samchow she always gets
fer own way.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The simple truth,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I sald, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]ny dear
Mrs. Havitand, is that Thea snd | found
ont that we were absolutely diferent

45 tastes and opinions.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Of course! that is the proper thing.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]She is as serious as--this miusie-
room of yours.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \[OpenCurlyQuote]

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Most people consiler it.a ehanuing
reom.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Certainly. Thea is the most rharm-
ing of women--with one rival,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] She
smiled and held up her hands«deprecat-
ingly. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]My respect and admiration
have not lessened in the silghtest.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Iam glad of that,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] she cried, clasp-
ing her hands. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Bat tt makes me re-
gret alt the more that you--oh! why
should you?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Beraute I, on the other hand, am as
light as--your pretty pink room.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]As attractive in another way,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] she
observed, with a complimentary smile.

25. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Weil, the long and sbort of it is that

: Bree was always green and I was al-

\[OpenCurlyQuote]Ways pink; aud neither could change

the other.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Why need you try?" I nugbed a lit-

have persuaded her that no structural
alteration was necessary.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]She intimated her disapproral of
smoking and billiards the day after our
engagement,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Surely ste didn't insist on her ob-
jection. \[OpenCurlyQuote]That would be unreasonable,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Weil. no. She conceded smoking,
and @ liftie billiards; but she wanted
me to go to church about three times
® week, to give up betting--it's only =
trifle now and then, just for fun, tas-
sure you,"

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]i know, Like Fred.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] She vodsded.
Sirs. Haviland bets a pair of gloves ov-
casionally herself; and pays when she
foxes?

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]She wished me to avold music halla,
ts forswesr whisky, and to take her to
& lecture on the Primitive Something-
or-others once a week!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Why mot?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] My hostess shrugeed
her shoullers and hell out her hands
expansively, | shrugged my shontlers
with less elegance, but equal emphasis.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Because Fin--pink!" I said. She
atualied the bows on her slippers for a
few moments.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You were tery fond of her?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] she

asked, suddenly. I dropped my gloves

ond ploked them up again bifore an-
swering.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Yes,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I said, stubborniy, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I was.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
