The cannon's loud alarm.

Ami £ce the xmoke on distant felds
While alt around is calm;

To fest that we could battle, too,
Tt but the call would come,

And not be lagéing at the sound
Of bugic, Afé and drum,

Ani then, because our hopes grow faint,
Belf-trust la shattered; too:

Al lust we wonder, could we strike
Aa hacd as others do?

And could we stand the storm of tire,
The bulivts\[CloseCurlyQuote] dreadful hail,

Like that herole vanguatd stands,
Nor at the carnage quali?

Ah, sadier than to storm the height,
And on its slope to dic,

And cruetier than in the dust

--J, S. Taylor, in SN. ¥. Sun.

HERE was once a learned doctor

who had stadiet tong and hard,

but in Cucuguano, where he had set-

tied, na one had faith In him. Meet-

fog him niwoys with a book in his
hand. the Cucuguanese said:

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]That doctor knows nathing, hy is
alwats stadying; ifhe studies sy much,
it means ht hos need to learn; if he
needs ti learn, it means he does not
know; if he does not know, he ia an
ignoramus.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

A doctor without petients is like a
lamp without of. Without other re-
goureces, foreed therefore to earn m liv-

@ng by hook or by crook, up to this time

the poor devil had not been able even
to pay for the water he drank. He de-
cided there would have to be achange.
So one day he managed to spread
abroad throngh afl Cucuguano the re-
port that his science was 20 sublime
end all-powerful that not only conti

Jhe heal the sick--mere child's play--

at raise the dead as well, a ntiracle of
Gel, surely, And this oiirack\[CloseCurlyQuote] he
promised to perform openly in bread
dax, in the graveyard amid the multi-
tude.

Few gave credence to the report.
Yet even the Ineredulous said: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We
will Jet him atiempt lt. anyhow. Let's
sve him at work--the proof ofthe puil-

ing is the eating. He may sucecedt--,
he reads su much, and nowadays such
wonderful discoveries are being mate.
RF he succeeds, we will applaad kim, if
not, we will hiss him out of the conn-

_tryside. Let him bring a man to life

again and we will say he is the elever-
est doctor we have ever had.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Finally it was xettied that on the fol-
lowing Sunday, at the stroke of noen,
in the ceiny tery of Chensudane, the doe-
tor would raise x man from the dcad--
nihe or ten, some old women went ao

That Sunday, long before noon, the
gtateyard was as jammed as is the
chutch on Holy Easter day. Truc ta
his word, on the second stroke of the
bell appeared the ductors, all in blaek.
He ¢ibowed his war to the steps of the
central cross. There he saluted the
crow, spat on the ground, blew his
