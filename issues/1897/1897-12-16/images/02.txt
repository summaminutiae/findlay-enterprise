Bare you from the hospital. It will put new life inte you,

The following ietter shows how Mrs. Lyness escaped the hospital and a
fearful operation. Her experience should ¢ncourage
other women to follow herexample. She says
to Mrs. Pinkham:

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]i thank you very much for what you have
done for me, for l had given up in despair.
Last February, 1 had a niiscarriage caused
br overwork. It affected my heart. caused
me to have sinking spells three to foura
day, lasting sonietimes half a day. f
could not be left alone. 2 flowed con-
stantly. The doctor called twice a day
fora week, and once @ day forfour weeks,
then three or four times a week for four
\ months. Finally he said I would have to an-

dergoan operation. Theo I commenced taking y

Lydia E. Pinkham\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Vegetable Compound, and
after.one week I beran to recorer and steadily tnpeeted until I was cured
completely. ity taking the Pinkham medicine, I avoided an operation which
the doctor salad I would certainly have to undergo. 1 am gaining every day
and will cheerfully tell anyone what yor have done for me\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]--Mus. Tos.
