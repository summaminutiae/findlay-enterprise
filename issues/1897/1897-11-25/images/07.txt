He was rosy ehecked, and red wag his
wurly Hutte ticad,
And xeexed were the tromers that he
wore:
With a shiny, well-worn sult, and hie toce
half through hix boot,
But as merry aaa monkey \[OpenCurlyQuote]fore the door.
You could act him on the square,
arvind it everywhere,
When muddy were the sidewRks on the

street.
Qua @ swallow he would fly to cateh a

And « gentivman he eagerly would greet.

how many hearts were saddened. but i
was one of the exipencies of war, S man
became accustomed to many things.
barit was a great deal easier to shovt a
man while in the heat of battie than
when one bad time to reflect that he
was taking life. We could never deter-

was deaf, walking in his sleep, tery at-
sent-minded or crazy. Ti was one of
the sad mysteries of wartimer, and we
