Sugar-Free, Salt-Free Canning
Okay for Some Foods, Not for Others
Many Americans are trying to cut

down en the amount of sugar and salt

in their diets, and that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s good. But
when they reduce or eliminate the
salt and sugar in home-canning
recipes ... that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s not always so good.

It all depends on what you\[CloseCurlyQuote]re
canning. Sugar cannot be left our of
homemade james,
preserves. And salt must not be left
out or decreased in fermented
pickles or sauerkraut.

Whole and chunk fruits may be
canned without sugar, but you might
not like the color, flavor or texture as
much. While sugar improves the
quality of canned fruits, it is not
essential for a safe product.
Likewise, vegetables -- other than
fermented pickles, sauerkraut and
tomatoes -- may be safely canned
without salt. The safety will not be
harmed, only the quality.

Fruits that are canned in plain
water will tend to shrivel and
sometimes float. Hot-packing
(partly cooking the fruit before
putting it in the jars) will minimize
this problem.

Many cooks have found fruit juice

to be a happy medium between sugar

syrup and plain water. Apple juice or
white grape juice is pale and bland
enough in flavor that it won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t mask
the other fruit flavors.

Canning fruits with artificial
sweeteners is not a good idea. When
it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s heated, the sweetener will turn
bitter and the final product will likely
be inedible. If you want to use ar-

jellies or

tificial sweeteners on home-canned
fruit, it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s best to wait until serving
time

It is recommended to use the fruit
juice as you would water or syrup,
and process the fruit for the usual
length of time in a boiling-water
bath.

Salt-free vegetables should also be
processed for the usual amount of
time -- but in a pressure-canner. It is
not recommended to use salt sub-
stitutes in home-canned foods
because they leave a bitter or
metallic aftertaste. For best taste,
these should be added to the
vegetable at the table.

If you have any questions about
canning or are in need of approved
recipes, please contact the

tive Extension Service at
774-4812.

Suntanned Today -- Sorry Tomorrow

If you are headed for a day at Lake
Shelbyville, make sure you have
packed your sun screen.

Sun worshippers of all ages take
pride on their healthy glow, but it can
be very costly. Severe burns,
premature wrinkling and drying of
the skin, and skin cancer are just
some of the unhealthy side effects
that are caused from excessive

ing.

About 400,000 cases of skin cancer
occur each year in this country, and
more than 7,000 people die each year
of skin cancer. Although most of
these cancers are highly curable,
most of them are also highly
preventable.

When you spend time in the
summer sun, be sure to protect
yourself. We all need to learn to be
satisfied with a modest tan,
gradually acquired. Early morning
or late afternoon tanning sessions
are best, because the sun\[CloseCurlyQuote]s burning
rays are most intense between noon
and three.

It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a good idea to take advantage
of the sun-screening preparations on
the market. Be sure to read the
labels to be sure you know what
you\[CloseCurlyQuote]re buying. Some of these
products promote a tan, while others
actually screen out the rays of the
sun to protect your skin. Baby oil and
hand lotions may make your skin feel
softer, but they won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t screen out the
sun\[CloseCurlyQuote]s rays.

Parents need to pay special at-
tention to babies and toddlers
because they need extra-special
protection from the summer sun. A
few minutes of full sun is all a fair-
skinned child should be exposed to at
one time. Young children who spend
a lot of time outdoors in the early
afternoon should be protected with a
sun-screening product made
especially for sensitive skin.

holding their annual Officers
Training School at 9:30 a.m. Mon-
day, June 30 in the Home Ec

couraged to attend are unit chair-
