the next fiscal year should be around
$75,000. This figure includes not only

Making an appeal ior funds for the
Findlay Summer Baseball Program
was Teddy Scott. She appeared
before the board on behalf of
baseball commissioner Mike Tucker
who had a game to coach.

Scott told the board there was a
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]tremendous increased use\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] which
encouraged volunteers to build a
second ball diamond. She said CIPS
has agreed to provide poles and
lights to put lighting on the new

being used by more and more groups
and cited the Baptist Church and a
growing list of families that use the
center for showers, reunions and
other family gatherings.

Perry said the Findlay Lioness
Ciub had just donated a new stove to
the center. The next piece of
equipment needed is an air con-
ditioner, she explained.

Speaking on behalf of the village,
Ryherd said he would like to order a
new 300 ft. hose for the village sewer
machine. The hose is estimated to
cost approximately $1,000.

Another equipment need -- a
computer for the village office -- will
also be considered when the village
board makes appropriations: The
board has previously discussed using
revenue sharing funds to purchase a
computer for the office.

Riley proposed the use of revenue
sharing funds to repair or replace
sidewalks around the village.

proposal for the village board,
Cherry and McBride told the board
they would need additional in-
formation. A proposal may be
available within 30 days.

Both representatives of H.E.R. &
Associates and the village board
agreed the present sewage treat-
ment plant was more sophisticated
than was necessary for a village the
size of Findlay.

Cherry told the board Findlay
probably only needed a plant one-
quarter the size of the present plant
and less complicated to operate.

McBride asked for various in-
formation about the plant operations
such as the annual operation-
maintenance budget, approximately
$36,000; the bonds to be paid off,
$448,000; the annual power bill,
approximately $9,300 for gas and
electric; and the sewer rates, $6.32
for the first 1,600 gallons and $3.95 for
every 1,000 gallons (based on water
use).
