The north elevator of Livergood
Grain Co. is a shambles and soon will
have been burned and gone forever.

I hate to see landmarks disappear,
but they\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve replaced it with
something better. I guess there\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
something to be said for that. As I
hear it the south bin will follow
behind the north one so there'll no
doubt be some empty space to get
used to. The two buildings have
served the community long and well,
but new ways of doing things are
being found everyday, and I guess

the A.B. Staley Co. decided the huge
bins would work better.

I wonder what will happen to the
ramps that lead to each of the
elevators. The kids loved them when
there was enough snow for sliding.
Maybe we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll like the new
arrangement even better once we get
used to it.

Do you know that a part of the hold
up in building Eagle Creek Resort
has to do with historical sites and the
Indiana Brown bat? I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know
where the precious historical sites
are, but I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve been told that one is part
of a concrete slab where a barn used
to sit. The other one I know about is
some concrete or blocks left from a
once upon a time country church.

Now if either the barn or church
existed I might see some interest in
the history of them, but the way it is
no one knows or cares about them.

I guess there were many other
sites that caused the layout of the
resort to change. The developer
wanted to have the golf course ready
- to seed in October, but another
problem was encountered. Trees will
have to be cut for the course, but they
can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be cut until after Sept. 15. Now
that rule has something to do with an
endangered bird species called the
Indiana Brown bat. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve seen a lot of
birds, but I wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t even aware that
bird existed. Maybe it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s more en-
dangered than they thought. If it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s
important enough to hold up a
project of that magnitude I'd like to
see one. If I do, it will probably be
from a picture in a book.

Rainfall report

Practically all of Shelby County
experienced a rainless week June 13-
19 with just five townships recording
rainfall ranging from .02 to .1 of an
inch.

The recorded precipitation was .06
of an inch in Penn Township, .03 of an
inch and a trace in Pickaway
Township, zero in two Ridge, Okaw
and Todd\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Point townships.

Hospital note

Everett Wildman of Findlay was
moved last Friday from Decatur
Memorial Hospital to Shelby
Memorial Hospital in Shelbyville.

Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you think it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a wee bit early
to be playing with firecrackers? I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve
heard that some people have been
wakened from a sound sleep when
their neighbors decided to play with
firecrackers, rockets and the likes of
such. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve also been told that a group
of youngsters riding around have
been lighting and throwing them at
animals. Naturally the pet owners
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t like that much. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s just too
early for bang bangs yet.

_ The Shelbyville Kiwanis club has
donated a nice adddition to our mini
park. Several members installed a
covered bench in the northwest
corner of the park Saturday af-
ternoon. And if you\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll remember the
temperature was in the nineties.
They were working hard in all that
heat and using their Saturday af-
ternoon off to boot. Thanks
Kiwanians, we really do appreciate
it.

I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know a lot about the rules of
Medicare, but I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m going to find out
about them. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve heard on a few
occasions that the length of time a
person can stay is limited and that
some dying or desperately ill people
have been told they\[CloseCurlyQuote]d have to move
from the hospital. If this is true, then
I have no respect for those who made
the rules. In fact, I thought the
United States would go to any lengths
to see that their constituents had
much needed medical care. I really
like to think it wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t make such
cruel rules. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll find out and let you
know more about it in this column.

Findlay doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have a traditional
Fourth of July celebration, but
nevertheless, it will be a time to be
very careful. The traffic through
town will be very heavy and the
beaches will be loaded. There will be
more boats on the lake than usual so
if you\[CloseCurlyQuote]re planning to boat, fish, ski,
swim or enjoy any other activities
around the lake or use Division
Street, please do it very carefully.

County receives
grant to promote

use of seat belts

The Illinois Coalition for Safety
Belt Use announced last week a
$1,400 community education grant to
Rebecca Fathauer of the Shelby
County Health Dept. for their
program to compliance
with Illinois\[CloseCurlyQuote] safety belt use law.

The grant was one of 13 made by
the coalition to law enforcement
agencies, public health departments,
and community service groups
throughout the state.

ment plant, \[OpenCurlyQuote]we submit a budget,
and we live with it. If it runs over
that, we pick up the difference.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

In some cases the firm purchases
the sewage treatment plant from the
municipality and then leases it back.

Board members discussed ar-
bitration with the contractor over the
project. They also discussed the
possibility of other future litigation
to bring the plant up to standards
required by the Environmental
Protection Agency. The village is
still under a sewer ban because the
plant has not been approved since
construction was completed over

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]five years ago. .

McBride told the board that the
firm operates with local people
purchasing local materials. \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]We\[CloseCurlyQuote]re
not in here to knock loeal people out
of work. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m not going to drive down
here every day. We\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll be hiring local
people.\[CloseCurlyQuote] He also stressed that when
possible he would use local
businesses to purchase supplies.

Following the extensive discussion
with McBride and Cherry, Riley
made a motion authorizing the firm
to work up a proposal to operate and
or purchase the Findlay sewage
treatment plant. The proposal will be
made available at no cost to the
village. The motion was approved.

LETTERS WILL BE sent to the
owners of seven properties which
have been found to be a safety
hazard by village officials and
Rebecca Fathauer, sanitarian with
the Shelby County Health Dept.

Riley had met with Fathauer in
May to tour the village and examine
properties in need of work. In her
letter, Fathauer recommended
demolition for five of the seven
properties. On the other two
properties, she recommended
repairs to bring the buildings up to
safe standards.

In her letter to the village board,
Fathauer stated, \[OpenCurlyQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]The Shelby
County Health Dept. feels that each
of the seven properties inspected
have been allowed to become so
decayed, dilapidated and vermin
infested that they create a very real

hazard to the safety and welfare of -- sewage

the public.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Before a motion was made to send

letters to the property owners, Riley

~ made his own recommendation that
the board act on three of the
properties which are located in the
Findlay business district. These
three were a small building in the
alley off South Main, a building on
the corner of East South 2nd and
Dazey Street, and a garage located
behind an insurance business on
South Main.

Riley said he would like to work
with some of the property owners
and area residents in bringing the
buildings down at a minimum of
expense to the village. He pointed to
a house which the village purchased

Kathy Briney and Betty Eadie will
have parts in the performance of
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Brigadoon\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] at the Little Theatre on

have lived in the Phoebe Baxter
farm home for 17 years, moved a
couple of weeks ago to the Herschel
Bateman farm west of Todd\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Point.

The Findlay High School band will
present concerts each Wednesday
evening during the months of July
and August under the direction of
Jack Eadie, high school band

director. They will have. an ice

cream supper the night of their first
performance.

Five Years Ago
Employees of the Village of Fin-
dlay received an average wage in-

and was taken down by volunteers as
an example. 8

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We got rid of one house free down
by the water plant. We just let
everybody come in an get (what they
wanted) and pushed the building in
and burned it.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]

Trustee Bob Cox made the motion
to write letters to the property
owners explaining the findings of the
Shelby County Health Dept. and the
ordinance which covers the condition
of property.

Following a similar course of
action, the board made a motion to
direct Welch to make a tour of the
village and make a list of junk cars
or other inoperable motor vehicles.
Both the Findlay nuisance ordinance
and state statutes prohibit
inoperable motor vehicles from
being parked on village streets.

The board also:

* Approved a motion to adopt the
Prevailing Wage ordinance. At the
recommendation of village attorney
Mike Kiley, the board approved an
ordinance similar to the one recently
approved by the Shelby County
Board.

° Learned that the estimated cost
of extending natural gas service to
the new Eagle Creek resort would be
$123,000. Thurber reported the
estimate which was made by
engineer Jack Enloe. In a related
report he told the board a decision
would be made on which alternate
would be selected for the new access
road into the park.

e Heard a report that the
Shelbyville Kiwanis Club built a
covered bench in the Findlay Mini
Park. A letter of appreciation from
the board will be sent to the
Shelbyville organization.

° Heard a report that a mower
deck for the new mower still wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t
available, two months after the new
mower was purchased. Riley said he
was told by the dealer that a mower
deck would be taken off another new
unit for the village if their deck
wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t made available soon.

¢ Learned that McClain Electric
has not yet received a contract to
replace the control panels on the
atment plant from the
engineers. Ron McClain said
his father\[CloseCurlyQuote]s firm hadn't received the
documents, and they were needed to
order the equipment and supplies for
the project. The board a
McClain Electric\[CloseCurlyQuote]s bid for the work
in May.

The next regular monthly meeting
of the village board will be held at 7
p.m. Monday, July 14 in the village

missioners will work on ap-
propriations for the different
departments before the meeting.
