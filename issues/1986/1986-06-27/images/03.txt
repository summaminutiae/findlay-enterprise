Last week two elevators -- one built in 1942 and the other dating back to the late 1800s -- were demolished.
On the site of one of the old elevators, there are plans to install a large metal tank.

Two elevators are demolished

A Findlay landmark came down
last week.

Two old elevator buildings have
been leveled. The north elevator was
built in the spring of 1942 by Ed
Dazey. This elevator was to replace
one that had burned down sometime
in the late 1930\[CloseCurlyQuote]s, according to
George Dixon, manager of the
Livergood Grain Co.

Dixon said it is believed that the
south elevator was constructed
sometime in the late 1800s. °

According to information from the
Shelby County Historical &
Genealogical Society, Gould
Brothers of Windsor built the first
elevator in Findlay on the south side
of Main Street.

The elevator was later taken over
by Farmer\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Grain Co. Later,
William Truitt built another elevator
south of the first one along the
railroad tracks. This elevator was
later destroyed by fire. After that,
Davis Grain Co. built another
elevator.

At one time, according to
Historical Society information,
Findlay had three firms purchasing
grain.

There are plans in the process for
the site of the two demolished
elevators.

Dixon said that on the location
where the north elevator was, a large
metal tank will be installed. There

_are no immediate plans to replace

CORRECTION

It was reported in the Enterprise
last week that Findlay High School
vocational agriculture instructor
Brian Wood asked the school board
to okay the purchase of a tractor for

the ag program. The wrong price for ©

the tractor was reported in the
newspaper. The correct price for the
tractor is $3,700.

We regret the error.

the south elevator.

A.E. Staley has been upgrading the
Findlay elevator since last summer.
They installed a new dryer last fall
and all new spouting and raised all of
the elevator legs, Dixon said. The
result being faster grain handling is
now possible.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We're trying to give farmers
faster and better service,\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote] Dixon
said.

Livergoods owned the. elevator
from 1944 to 1976 when it was pur-
chased by the A.E. Staley Mfg. Co. of
Decatur. Dixon has been manager or
assistant manager of the elevator for
38 years. Tom Keim was manager
for 40 years.

Your Dental
HEALTH

CHILDHOOD INJURY

The primary cause of tooth loss among children is not tooth decay. It is
trauma. It is the two front teeth that are most likely to be injured by a
blow or a fall. Recent studies indicate that dental trauma is most likely to
occur between the ages of one and two. This is when babies are just
learning to walk. The other key ages are between seven and ten years.
During this span, children seem to be particularly active. To guard
against such injuries, children should be closely supervised. Also, by
igned teeth, a child\[CloseCurlyQuote]s risk of injury can be lowered. It

correcting misalign

may even help his speaking and eating. A child\[CloseCurlyQuote]s bite should be evaluated

by age four.
- Careful m

onitoring of children\[CloseCurlyQuote]s teeth should begin at a very early age.

Have them develop the habit of visiting the dentist regularly to catch any
small problem before it develops into something more serious. Make
them understand that the dentist is their friend, one who will make sure
that their teeth are always going to be strong and beautiful.
