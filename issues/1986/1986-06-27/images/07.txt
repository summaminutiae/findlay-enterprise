Around the County _

By Edward N. Ballard

. Shelby Co, Extension Adviser

Wheat harvest is pretty well
completed around Shelby County,
approximately two weeks ahead of
normal schedule. This is very typical
of the season with everything coming
along ten days to two weeks ahead of
what we would normally expect.

Of the wheat yields remaining,
farmers were reporting a little
higher yields than what they had
normally expected. To date, I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve
heard yield reports all the way from
25 bushels to 65 bushels per acre. The
normal range seems to be between 35
and 45 bushels per acre. The quality
seems to be exceptionally good this
year.

The wheat yields op the Kenneth
Diehl Extension Vo. Ag. Demon-
stration plots range from 6.7 bushels
to 41.5 bushels per acre. The effects
of the winter damage was quite
apparent on the variety plot along
with the other wheat plots and ex-
onely high bird damage this year

The top yielding variety was
Auburn, 41.5 bushels per acre; Hart,
40.3; Roland, 39.8; Pioneer 2551, 30.0;
Magnum, 18.5; Becker, 18.7; Scotty,
12.1; Arthur 71, 11.0; Pike, 12.1;
Tyler, 9.4; FS 402, 9.3; Hybrix
HW3021, 10.6; and Caldwell, 6.7
bushels per acre.

With the early harvest this would
be quite advantageous for double
cropping of soybeans if you have
adequate moisture. Most farmers
said they were not going to double
crop because they didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t feel there
was enough moisture there to ger-
minate the beans. Some areas might
have received enough rainfall on
Sunday .evening, June 22, to ei
courage them to go ahead and double
crop.

Corn Tasseling

Corn started tasseling around
Shelby County this past weekend.
This is extremely early for the corn
to tassel. We always hear the old

Activities begin with the landing of
a U-H helicopter at 11 a.m. and
continue until 5 p.m., according to an
announcement made Friday by the

ice.

The flyover by a F4 Phantom jet is
slated for 11:15 a.m. with Horizon to
take the stage at 11:30 a.m. and
again at 2:30 p.m.

All activities will be held at the
Shelbyville beach.

saying corn should be knee-high by
July 4, it is certainly outdated in
today\[CloseCurlyQuote]s modern agriculture. In fact,
it looks like the majority of the corn
will be tasseled by July 4 this year.

We also want to remind farmers
that they should not be spraying
postemergence spray on corn from
the tassel to dough stage. A lot of
farmers have been busy spraying
with 2,4-D and _  Banvel
postemergence for broadleaf control
in corn and once the tassels start
appearing then they should stop
spraying with these postemergence
sprays.

Turkey Production

In order to improve farm income a
group has organized an Illinois
Turkey Grower Coop. Its intent is to
produce 1.5 million turkeys annually
for the coop to be processed through
their marketing channels.

The coop presently is engaged and
seeking out those farmers who have
existing poultry facilities or con-
vertible buildings, explaining their
program

utilizing
they may be able to realize a sub-
stantial supplemental income.

If you would be interested or have
building facilities and would like
more information contact the Shelby
County Cooperative Extension of-
fice, and we can provide you with

future to supp:
Looking at different types of alter-
native crops will be given more
emphasis in the future. Recently we
had one farmer in Shelby County who
has gone into asparagus production.
I think this is just another example of
a way we might be diversifying our
farm income in the future.

question of condominium sales

CARLYLE, Ill. (AP) -- The U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers has vetoed
a proposal for a $125 million resort
development on the southern shore of
ae Lake, a corps spokesman
said.

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It was rejected because that
would be a private use of existing
public land,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said Dennis Hogan of
the corps\[CloseCurlyQuote] real estate division in St.
Louis.

The resort plan presented by
Spruce Development Co. of

- Bloomfield Hills, Mich., called for
construction of an unspecified
number of condominiums at South
Shore State Park, Hogan- said
Monday.

Although the proposal called for
construction at a state park, the
26,000-acre lake is administered by

Gov. James R. Thompson \[OpenCurlyQuote]sent us
a letter last week asking us to
reconsider the proposal, but the
proposal has not changed,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said.
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Corps policy says there has to be

Hogan and Ron Chezem, property
manager for the Illinois Dept. of
Conservation, said Spruce was the
only major developer considering a
resort at Carlyle Lake.

Preliminary talks with the
developer focused on plans for a
marina that would accommodate
more than 1,000 boats, a hotel with a
sports complex, convention facilities
and two golf courses, and the con-
dominiums, Chezem said.

Springfield.

But Paul Nine, the president of
Spruce Development, said he had
been told by the Corps that its policy
against condominiums was firm.

Without the condominiums to
make a profit for the project, he no
longer would be interested in a
development at the lake, Nine said
Monday, adding he doubted the corps
could find another developer if that
restriction remained.
